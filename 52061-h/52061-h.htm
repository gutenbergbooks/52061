<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Pyrenees stand up as a natural wall of demarcation
between two nations, the French and the Spaniards,
just as the mountains of Dauphiné sever the French from the
Italians. It has been remarked that these natural barriers
are thrown up to part Romance-speaking peoples, whereas
the mountain ranges sink to comparative insignificance
between the French and the Germans. Over the Jura the
French tongue has flowed up the Rhone to Sierre, above the
Lake of Geneva, so the Spanish or Catalan has overleaped
the Pyrenees in Roussillon, and the Basque tongue has those
who speak it in both cis-Pyrenean and trans-Pyrenean
Navarre. The Pyrenees are the upcurled lips of the huge
limestone sea-bed, that at some vastly remote period was
snapped from east to west, and through the fissure thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
formed the granite was thrust, lifting along with it the sedimentary
rocks.</p>

<p>Consequently the Pyrenees consist of from two to three
parallel chains. The central and loftiest is that of granite,
but where loftiest is hidden on the north side by the upturned
reef of limestone. On the south the calcareous bed is
lifted in great slabs, but split, and does not form so ragged
and so lofty a range.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees start steeply out of the Mediterranean,
which at a distance of five-and-twenty miles from Cape
Creuse, has a depth of over 500 fathoms, and there the
limestone flares white and bald in the line of the Albères.
But to the west the chain does not drop abruptly into the
Atlantic, but trails away for 300 miles, forming the Asturian
mountains, and then, curving south, serves to part Galicia
from Leon. The range of the Pyrenees dividing France from
Spain is 350 miles in length.</p>

<p>The chain to the west wears a different aspect from that in
the east. The Basque mountains are clothed with trees,
pines and birch, walnut and chestnut, and above them are
turf and heather. But the eastern extremity is white and
barren. This is due to the fact that the Western Pyrenees
catch and condense the vapours from the Atlantic, whereas
the Oriental Pyrenees do not draw to them heavy and
continuous rains. The boundary between the regions and
climates is Mont Carlitte. In the Western Pyrenees the
snow line lies far lower than in the east. On the former
of these glaciers hang in wreaths, whereas there are none in
the east.</p>

<p>The contrast between the northern and southern slopes
is even more marked than that between the extremities of
the chain. On the French side are snow, ice, running streams,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
fertile vales, luxuriant meadows and forests, and valleys and
hillsides that sparkle with villages smiling in prosperity. But
on the southern slope the eye ranges over barren rocks, sun-baked,
scanty pastures, and here and there at long intervals
occur squalid clusters of stone hovels, scarce fit to shelter
goats, yet serving as human habitations.</p>

<p>To the mountaineers the French side is <i>bach</i>, that in shadow;
the Spanish is <i>soulane</i>, the sunny. At one time this latter
slope was not as arid and desert as at present, but the thriftlessness
of man has shorn down the forests and the teeth of
the goats have nipped off or barked every seedling or sapling
thrown up by nature to cover its nakedness and redress the
evil. Thereby the rainfall has been diminished, and the soil
is exposed to be carried away into the plain by every storm
that breaks over the heights.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Trees are the patient workers
that reconstitute the flesh over the bones of the mountains.
They derive their elements from the air and the rock, and
they perform transformations far more wonderful than those
attributed to the philosopher’s stone. As Victor Hugo

<p>When the trees disappear from a country it shows the
thriftlessness of the inhabitants&mdash;“sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof”; with the axe and the firebrand they
destroy in a day what it will take centuries to replace.</p>

<p>Two non-French races occupy the extremities of the chain
and the lowlands at its feet. In the Basses Pyrénées are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the Basques, in Pyrénées Orientales are the Catalonians,
speaking a dialect of the Spanish of Barcelona.</p>

<p>The whole of Aquitaine, from the Loire to the Pyrenees,
the whole of Western Spain and Portugal, was once occupied
by the Iberians, of whom the Basques are the shrunken
residue. All Eastern France and Eastern Spain were overflowed
by the Celts. The Romans recognized that Spain
was in the possession of two races totally distinct, ethnographically
and linguistically, and they termed the population
of the peninsula Celtiberians.</p>

<p>When the Romans arrived on the scene they carried one
main causeway from Arles to Narbonne, and thence to
Toulouse, and from Toulouse to Dax. From this, roads
branched to the south and crossed the Pyrenees into Spain by
three gaps, natural doorways&mdash;one to the east, the easiest of
all, by Le Perthus, where Pompey set up a trophy; one by
Somport leading from Iluro (Oloron) to Saragossa; a third
by Roncevaux to Pampeluna.</p>

<p>By the first of these ports Hannibal crossed from Spain on
his way to Italy; by it also poured the Saracens to devastate
the fields of Gaul. By Roncevaux Charles the Great passed
to menace the Saracen power, and on his return met there
with disaster at the hands of the Basques, which has been
immortalized in song.</p>

<p>East and west were debatable lands. Navarre sat astride
on the ridge, with a foot in Spain and the other in Gascony.
To the east was Roussillon, that pertained to the kings of
Aragon, till ceded definitely to France in 1659.</p>

<p>But to revert to the geological structure of the Pyrenees.
The central chain is, as already said, composed of crystalline
rocks, granite, and micaceous schist, whereas the northern
chain exhibits the upturned beds of superincumbent deposits,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and on the Spanish side the limestone lies on the granite.
In the department of Haute Garonne the chains are soldered
together by a transverse bar of mountain.</p>

<p>J. H. Michon, author of <i>Le Maudit</i>, says <span class="locked">well:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“These mountains reveal to me almost the entire history of
the successive periods in the terrestrial crust. I have but to
follow the torrent of the Arbouste, and mount to the Lac de
Seculéjo, and push farther to the Pic d’Espingo, to find myself
on the crest of the ridge dividing France from Spain. Often
at these altitudes, reaching to 3000 metres above the sea, the
prodigious force which has rent the terrestrial crust in a fault
of eighty leagues in breadth, which has upheaved, as in the
Marboré, enormous masses of limestone that once formed the
basin of seas succeeding each other at different epochs&mdash;often
has this phenomenon filled me with amazement. There in the
Marboré lie the beds, retaining their horizontality, as though
the aqueous deposits had been formed at this great elevation.</p>

<p>“But more commonly the central chain presents to our view
masses of granite of astounding thickness. What a terrible
cataclysm must that have been which thus reft and upset the
globe, changing an extensive plain long submerged into a
gigantic wall of granite shielded right and left with encasing
masses of sedimentary formations which the upheaved granite
has split and displaced in all directions.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To the north of the Pyrenees lies a deep trough extending
from the Bay of Biscay to the Corbières that links the
Pyrenees to the Cevennes, and which at the present day forms
the watershed between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
This gulf was gradually silted up by the torrents from the
Pyrenees. Masses of rubble may be seen backing and capping
isolated hills of sandstone, and forming long ridges, as that
of the Park at Pau. The drift was from east to west. All
the low hills are crowned with rolled stones. The boulders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
vary in size in proportion to the distance they have travelled.
At Pamiers, Tarbes, and Pau they are of the size of a child’s
head, but farther north dwindle to pebbles and gravel, and
finally we enter on a region of clay and sand, which heavy
rains convert into quagmires. Indeed, those of Armagnac,
between the Garonne and the Upper Adour, have hardly their
equal in France. These are not glacier deposits, for the stones
and pebbles have been rolled, and the clay or mud is the
chewed or mumbled remains of boulders. At a later period the
entire basin thus choked was lifted high above its original level.</p>

<p>That there was a glacial period in the south of France is
certain, and the glaciers have left their moraines behind them.
The glacier of Argelez extended in one stream to Lourdes,
and then fanned out towards Tarbes. At Argelez it filled
the valley to the height of 4430 feet. To morraine is due
the desolate plain of detritus of Lannemezan. Separated
from the mountain spurs by the profound depression in which
flows the Neste, it is attached to the main chain solely by the
isthmus that runs out from the Pic d’Arneille towards the
plains.</p>

<p>The true watershed, between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean,
lies far to the east, on the frontier between Ariège and
the Pyrénées Orientales. All the streams and rivers to the west
of the insignificant chain there flow into the Bay of Biscay.
The rivers to the east are comparatively unimportant, the
Aude alone being of a respectable size; and this does not
derive its waters from the main chain of the Pyrenees, its
sources are in the spur that acts as the watershed.</p>

<div id="if_p7" class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;"><img src="images/p007.jpg" width="435" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE CASCADE, GAVARNIE</div></div>

<p>The lakes of the Pyrenees are nothing more than mountain
tarns; the largest is the Lac Lanoux, in Pyrénées Orientales,
lying below an irregular cirque, commanded by the Pic
Pédroux. It stands 6500 feet above the sea-level, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
about two and a half miles long. It is usually frozen over
from September to the end of June.</p>

<p>But if the lakes be insignificant, the cirques are of the most
imposing character. There are none in Europe comparable
to that of Gavarnie. This consists of an immense cul-de-sac,
a vast amphitheatre, the stages of limestone capped with
snow and ice, and above it tower five huge snow-clad mountain
crests. The arena is heaped up with rubble brought
down by the cascades. The mighty walls are wept over by
water from the thawing glaciers. The highest fall of all is
that in the lap of the cirque; it is a stream that precipitates
itself from a height of 1270 feet, and, speedily resolving itself
into spray, waves in the air like an ostrich plume. Superb
as is the Cirque de Gavarnie in summer its appearance in
winter is even more sublime. Especially is it so when the
mountain-tops are enveloped in vapour. Then the aspect
is as of a series of walls with snow bars intervening, mounting
as a giant staircase into heaven; and the cascades are transformed
into crystal columns.</p>

<p>There are other cirques deserving of notice, as that of
Estaubé, commanded by the Pic de Pinède, behind which
rises the Mont Perdu, on Spanish ground.</p>

<p>Troumousse, to the east of Estaubé, is a basin of pasture,
girded about by a rampart 3000 feet in height, above which
soars the Munia, a mass of snow and ice.</p>

<p>From the French side long lush valleys run to the roots of
the first chain between the buttresses, but above this the
character of the scenery changes abruptly. The melted
snows descending from peak and terrace have sawn their way
through the barrier imposed by the northern belt of limestone,
feeling for and finding faults, through which they have torn
their way, and debouch abruptly on to the lower broad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
valleys out of restricted ravines. Above these gorges we
light on basins, such as that of Luz, green, in spring a sheet
of gold from the crocuses. These were lake-beds, dried up
when the torrents had contrived their escape. The rich vale
of Ossau, between monotonous spurs, ends abruptly above
Laruns, and there, through a cleft in the precipice, rages
forth the Gave. It is much the same with the other Gave.
Above Lourdes it glides through a broad, well-cultivated
valley, but at Pierrefite, the mountain barrier is cleft in two
places, through one of which roars forth the river from Luz,
through the other the Gave from Cauterets. The Val de
Campan, the Val d’Arreau, and that of Luchon, have much
the same character.</p>

<p>Of the mountains, undoubtedly the Pic de Midi d’Ossau is
the most conspicuous, not on account of its height, for it
attains only to 8700 feet, but from its form, resembling a
dog’s tooth, cleft near the summit, glittering with snow, and
rising in singular majesty above the Val d’Ossau, where the
mountains fall back respectfully to allow a full view of its
majesty. There are many noble mountains,&mdash;the Pic de
Midi de Bigorre, 9436 feet; the Vignemale, 10,820 feet;
Mont Perdu, 11,168 feet; Maladetta of the same height
almost to a foot; but these last hold themselves screened
behind the inferior but snow-clad northern range. The
Canigou, however, belongs to this latter range, and is afflicted
with none of the retiring qualities of the crystalline range.
It steps boldly, ostentatiously forth above the plain of
Roussillon, and for long was supposed to be the highest peak
of the Pyrenees, though actually reaching only to 8360 feet.
M. Élisée Reclus says of <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Like Etna, the Canigou is one of those mountains which
rise vigorous as masters over a wide stretch of country. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
below this grey pyramid, cleft with ravines, streaked with
detritus between salient ribs of rock, of every tint, is not a
whit less striking in aspect than the Sicilian volcano.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To the lover of flowers the Pyrenees present greater attractions
than even the Alps. They lie farther to the south,
enjoy more sun, and exhibit a greater luxuriance of vegetation
and more variety in species. We meet in the Pyrenees
with all old Alpine friends and make fresh acquaintances.
Nowhere does the <i>Saxifraga longifolia</i> or <i>pyramidalis</i> throw
up such a <i>jet-d’eau</i> of blossom. I have grown it at home,
but it does not equal the beauty and abundance of flower
as here wild. Nowhere are the geraniums in greater abundance
and variety, springing up among the tufts of sharp-scented
box. The crimson <i>Erodium manescavi</i>, the yellow <i>Hypericum
mummularium</i>, the imbricated <i>Dianthus monspessulanus</i>,
and the still more tattered <i>Dianthus superbus</i>, the
purple toothwort, the blue stately aconite or monkshood,
the lemon-coloured <i>Adonis vernalis</i>, the violet <i>Ramondia
pyrenaica</i>, the <i>Primula viscosa</i> and <i>P. auricula</i>, the <i>Lilium
bulbiferum</i>, the <i>Lilium pyrenaicum</i>, and a thousand more.
Strange is it that the Alpen rose, the <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i>,
should be as capricious a plant as it is. It luxuriates on
the Alps, in the Pyrenees, and in the Dauphiné Alps; but
does not appear in the Cevennes, the mountains of
Auvergne, or Corsica. The great central plateau of France,
though the heights rise to considerable altitudes and
the constituent rocks are the same as those of the Pyrenees
and the Alps, yet are totally devoid of this beautiful
shrub.</p>

<p>The earliest inhabitants of the chain of the Pyrenees have
left their traces in the limestone caverns. They were contemporary
with the reindeer, the cave-bear, and hyena.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Hardly a grotto that has been explored does not reveal that
these men had lived there.</p>

<p>There are not many megalithic monuments to the north
of the chain, but sufficient remain to show us that the dolmen-builder
occupied the land from sea to sea. At Buzy, near
the entrance to the Val d’Ossau, is a fine dolmen. I saw it
first in 1850; it had been recently dug out by a treasure-seeker.
A peasant told me that the man who had rifled it
had found a bar of gold so soft that he could bend it. In
fact, it consisted of pure gold without alloy. Near the dolmen
lay a slab of red sandstone, with circles carved on it, some
concentric, much like the carvings on the stones of Gavr’innis,
in Brittany, and in the great covered way at Drogheda,
in Ireland. Not having a drawing book with me nor a scale,
all I could do at the time was to sketch the sculpture on my
cuff. Three weeks later I revisited Buzy to make a careful
drawing to scale of the slab, and found that in the meantime
it had been broken up by the road-menders.</p>

<p>The road from Pau to Tarbes traverses a vast plateau,
rising 300 feet above the plain of the Adour. It is composed
of marshy moorland covered with fern and gorse.
This is actually the old moraine deposited by the glacier of
Argelez. It is made up of angular blocks brought down
from the mountains, excellent material from which to construct
mortuary cells. And on this plateau we find tumuli
in remarkable abundance. This, as well as Lannemezan,
must have served as huge cemeteries. Of late these cairns
have been excavated, and prove to cover dolmens and covered
avenues; one, the Grande Butte of the lande of Pontacq,
contains a megalithic chamber, recalling the finest monuments
of the kind in Brittany.</p>

<p>The tumulus of La Hallade had been violated in the Iron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Age, and used then as a place of interment; but underneath
the cinerary urns of the Early Gaulish period was discovered
the prehistoric monument intact&mdash;a long low gallery of stones
set on edge and covered with flat slabs. It was subdivided
into eight cells, and contained twenty-three vases, some of
which contained burnt bones, flakes of schist and quartz,
a handful of turquoise beads, and a little blade of gold.</p>

<p>That the people of the rude stone monuments have their
modern representatives in the Basques is probable. All this
region was held by the Vascones, who gave to it their name&mdash;Gascony.
They were driven over the Pyrenees by the Gauls,
but in the sixth century they forced their way back to their
old dwelling places and the tombs of their fathers, and falling
on Novempopulania, as the territory was then called, defeated
the Duke Bladastus, in 581, and settled down on the plains.
But they were beaten in their turn, and, abandoning the plains,
settled in those districts known as Labourde, Soule, and
Lower Navarre.</p>

<p>The Basques are a people of great interest to the ethnologist,
as the last shrunken remains of that Iberian race that
once occupied all Western Europe from Scotland to Portugal
and Spain, and, indeed, overleaped the Straits and spread as
Kabyles and Berbers in Northern Africa. Although overlapped
by other races this Basque element forms the main
constituent of the French race in the south-west.</p>

<p>Every cook knows what “stock” is. It is the basis on which
almost every known kind of soup is built up, whether Julienne,
soupe claire, à la marquise, à la vermicelle, and Mrs. Beeton
only knows how many more. The Iberian has been the
stock out of which the English, Irish, Welsh, French, Italians,
and Spaniards have been concocted. In France there was
a dash of Gaulish, a smack of the Roman, a soupçon of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Frank, <i>et voilà</i>; the Frenchman of to-day is at bottom an
Iberian.</p>

<p>This same Iberian was an accommodating personage. He
was ready to abandon his own rudimentary tongue and
adopt the language of his conquerors. He cast his agglutinative
tongue behind his back, took in as much Latin as he
could swallow, and produced the French language. In Wales
he adopted the British tongue, in Ireland the Gaelic.</p>

<p>He was wise in so doing, for his own language, as represented
by the Basque of the present day, is crude, unformed,
and wanting in flexibility. The first stage in the formation
of speech is in the utterance of nouns substantive. A child
embraced by a stranger says, “Man kiss baby.” Kiss is a
noun substantive. The child has not as yet arrived at the
formation of a verb; and baby is a substantive, he has
not yet attained to the use of a personal pronoun. The
Chinese language remains in this primitive condition. In
it the position of the words in a sentence governs the
signification.</p>

<p>The second stage is that reached by the agglutinative
tongues, where a differentiation of the parts of speech has
taken place, and pronouns and particles acting as prepositions
are tacked on to the nouns and verbs, but in such an
elementary manner as never to become fused into them so
as to affect and alter them. Always their separate existence
is manifest. The third stage is where they are united and
interpenetrate each other. The soldering has been so close
that only a skilled eye can discover that an inflexion in a
verb, a case in a noun, are composite words.</p>

<p><i>Amo</i>, <i>amas</i>, <i>amat</i>, are actually formed of the root <i>ama</i>, love,
with primitive pronouns welded on to them so as to distinguish
the person who loves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
In Basque the auxiliary verbs alone undergo conjugation,
and they exhibit a peculiarity that deserves notice. Take
an instance: the auxiliary verb <i>izan</i>, to be. “I am” may
be rendered in four different ways, according to the person
addressed. In speaking to a male familiarly “I am” is
<i>nuk</i>; but a woman addressed in like manner is <i>nun</i>; “I
am,” when used in address to a person highly respected of
either sex, is <i>nuzu</i>; “I am” spoken without any particular
reference to any one is <i>niz</i>. So “he or she is” may be
rendered <i>duk</i>, <i>dun</i>, <i>duzu</i>, <i>da</i>; and “we are” by <i>gaituk</i>,
<i>gaitun</i>, <i>gaituzu</i>, <i>gare</i>.</p>

<p>The Basque language is capable of an incredible amount
of agglomeration in the formation of words, and of indefinite
modification of times, conditions, forms of words.</p>

<p><i>Etche</i> is a house; <i>argizagi</i> is the moon; <i>elhur</i> is snow;
<i>chori</i> is a bird; <i>sagar</i> an apple; <i>oski</i> a shoe; <i>aurhide</i> a child;
<i>arrolze</i>, an egg.</p>

<p>We feel at once that we meet here with a language which
has no relations that we can detect with any of the European
tongues with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>The Basque has not distinguished himself in literature. It
is true that a set of poems pretending to be ancient has been
produced and published as relics of Early Basque poetry,
but they were forgeries, like Macpherson’s <i>Ossian</i>.</p>

<p>The nucleus of the Basque country may be said to be
S. Jean-de-Luz. Formerly it was Ustaritz (i.e. the Oak of
Judgment), where the Elders assembled in Council; but at
the French Revolution this oak was cut down.</p>

<p>The Basque villages have a character of their own. Erected
by a people who do not feel eagerness to look in at one another’s
windows, a people pushing independence to fanaticism, the
villages consist rather of isolated buildings loosely united<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
than of close agglomeration of houses. Like the Welsh, the
Basques love whitewash, but paint their shutters brilliant
red. The churches stand in the midst of a clump of trees,
their towers surmounted by three points, symbolical of the
Trinity. They are a healthy people, clean in mind and clean
in body, religious and honest. The whole population has
been described as “la plus belle, la plus saine, la plus alerte,
la plus joyeuse qui se puisse se trouver en Europe.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> province of Gascony included Labourde, of which
Bayonne was the capital; the viscounty of Soule, with
Mauleon as its chief town; Basse Navarre; Béarn, a viscounty,
with its residential châteaux at Orthez and at Pau,
and its cathedrals at Lescar and Oloron; Bigorre, a county
with its capital at Tarbes; Cominges, and to the south of
that Couserans; and finally the county of Foix, on the
frontier of Languedoc.</p>

<p>The whole of this stretch of land was included by Augustus
in Aquitaine. This the peoples of Vasconia did not like, and
they sent to him an embassy to request that they might be
organized into a separate province. To this the emperor
agreed. Concerning this transaction history is silent; but we
know about it from a Roman inscription at Hasparren, set up
by the ambassador, to commemorate his journey and the
favourable reply he received.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century the viscounty of Béarn was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
annexed to the county of Foix, and the intervening county
of Bigorre fell to Foix in 1425, through the marriage of an
heiress. Finally, Navarre also was united to Foix-Béarn-Bigorre
in 1479. It furnished the holder with a royal title,
nothing more save the scrap of land on this side the Pyrenees
called Basse Navarre, of which the principal town was
S. Jean-pied-du-port.</p>

<p>Gascony should be of special interest to us English, as it
was for so long a possession of the English Crown.</p>

<p>Louis VII, before the death of his father, had contracted
marriage with Eleanor of Guyenne, heiress of Poitou and of
the duchy of Aquitaine. He obtained the most splendid
dower that ever fell to the lot of a French king. It consisted
of nothing less than half of the south of France. Eleanor
was a passionate, frivolous girl; Louis, a pale, feeble prince,
a prey to petty religious scruples. He took the cross and
started on the disastrous and disgraceful crusade of 1147.
He took Eleanor with him. She made no secret of her contempt
for her husband. “He is a monk, and not a man.”
She became over-intimate with her uncle, Raymond of
Antioch, the handsomest man of his time. She was accused
also of carrying on an intrigue with a Saracen. On her return
to Europe she insisted on being divorced from Louis, and she
cast herself into the arms of Henry Plantagenet, Count of
Anjou, Duke of Normandy, and heir to the crown of England.
Thus she detached all these provinces from France and annexed
them to the realm of England. Indeed, Henry, by
the marriage of one of his sons to the heiress of Brittany,
found himself master of nearly the whole of Western France.
The House of Anjou had sprung into domination on Gaulish
soil equal to that of the French king and his other vassals
put together, and controlling the mouths of the three great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
rivers. Add to all this the possession of the English kingdom.
The long protracted and desolating wars that ensued on
French soil was a struggle between the kings as to whether
France should be annexed to England, or Aquitaine to France.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“By the peace between Henry III and Louis IX,” says
Mr. Freeman, “Aquitaine became a land held by the King
of England as a vassal of the French crown. From that time
it became one main object of the French kings to change this
feudal superiority over this great duchy into an actual possession.
The Hundred Years’ War began through the attempt
of Philip of Valois (1337) on the Aquitanian dominions of
Edward III. Then the King of England found it politic to
assume the title of King of France. But the real nature of
the controversy was shown by the first great settlement. At
the Peace of Bretigny (1360) Edward gave up all claim to the
crown of France, in exchange for the independent sovereignty
of his old fiefs and of some of his recent conquests. Aquitaine
and Gascony, including Poitou ... were made over to the King
of England without the reservation of any homage or superiority
of any kind. These lands became a territory as foreign to the
French kingdom as the territory of her German and Spanish
neighbours. But in a few years the treaty was broken on the
French side, and the actual possessions of England beyond the
sea were cut down to Calais and Guines, with some small part
of Aquitaine adjoining the cities of Bordeaux and Bayonne.
Then the tide turned at the invasion of Henry V. Aquitaine
and Normandy were won back; Paris saw the crowning of an
English king, and only the central part of the country obeyed
the heir of the Parisian kingdom. But the final result of the
war was the driving out of the English from all Aquitaine and
France except the single district of Calais.</p>

<p>“The French conquest of Aquitaine (1451&ndash;3), the result of
the Hundred Years’ War, was in form the conquest of a land
which had ceased to stand in any relation to the French
crown.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Thus Aquitaine, including Gascony, had belonged to the
crown of England from 1152 to 1453, just three hundred and
one years.</p>

<p>But, although nominally pertaining to England, it contained
stubborn and recalcitrant elements, notably the
counts of Foix, who were viscounts of Béarn.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the eleventh century the viscounty
of Béarn had enjoyed sovereign rights, admitting allegiance
to none. Later, when Louis XI went in pilgrimage to Notre
Dame de Sarrance, he lowered the sword of France on entering
Béarn, as being no longer in his own kingdom. This
little territory during the Middle Ages was perhaps the best
governed corner of the earth, the freest and happiest in France,
and perhaps in all Europe. The <i>fors</i> of Béarn were the
liberties to which the viscount was required to swear adhesion
before he was recognized as sovereign. The earliest
of these <i>fors</i> is that of Oloron (1080), renewed in 1290, and
it is one of the earliest monuments extant of the Romance
tongue. By these constitutions the inhabitants of the
viscounty governed themselves.</p>

<p>An instance or two of the independent spirit of the Béarnais
may be given.</p>

<p>Marie, daughter of Peter, Viscount of Béarn, upon the
death of her brother, in 1134, became heiress. She had been
reared at the Court of Aragon, and had married William de
Moncada, a Catalonian noble. She had the weakness to do
homage to the king for Béarn. The people rose in revolt,
deposed her, and elected as their viscount a knight of Bigorre,
well spoken of for his virtues. He, however, disregarded
the <i>fors</i>, and attempted to rule as a feudal lord, whereupon
within a year he was assassinated. Then a knight of Auvergne
was chosen, and held the viscounty for two years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
But he also disregarded the constitution and was put to
death. Then his estates of Béarn sent a deputation to
Marie de Moncada, to inform her that it had come to their
ears that she had given birth to twin boys, and the people
authorized their commissioners to select one of the twins
to be their viscount. The deputation were shown the cradle
in which the infants lay; one slept with his hands open,
the other held his fists clenched. “We will have the open-handed
lad,” said the Béarnais, and he became Viscount
Gaston VI. On his death in 1170 his brother, the close-fisted
William Raymond, claimed the inheritance, but the
Béarnais refused to acknowledge his claim as one of right,
protesting that the viscountship was elective. They compelled
him to submit to their will, and accepted him
only when he had granted still greater liberties than they
had hitherto enjoyed, and this not till five years after the
death of his brother.</p>

<p>William Raymond died in 1223, leaving a son, William,
to succeed him, but he was killed in battle against the Moors
in 1229, and William’s son Gaston succeeded under the
regency of his mother Garsende. She is described as having
been so stout that only a large wagon could contain her, and
then she overlapped the sides. Gaston VII, son of this plump
lady, left an only child, a daughter Margaret, the heiress of
Béarn, which she carried with her when married to Roger
Bernard, Count of Foix. Thus it came about that Foix
and Béarn were united in one hand.</p>

<p>Roger Bernard and Margaret had a grandson, Gaston IX
of Béarn. At the age of eighteen he was married to Eleanor
of Cominges, a lady considerably older than himself.
Some one without tact remarked to the Countess on the
disparity of their ages. “Disparity of ages!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
she, “Why, I would have waited for him till he was
born.”</p>

<p>The young husband fell fighting against the Moors in 1343.
By his elderly wife he left a son, Gaston Phœbus, of whom
more when we come to Orthez.</p>

<p>Gaston Phœbus was succeeded by a cousin, Matthew de
Castelbon, who died in 1398, without issue, and he was
followed by his sister Isabella, married to Archibald, Captal
de Buch, a just and worthy ruler. They had a son, John of
Béarn, who succeeded his mother in 1426. He captured the
antipope, Benedict XIII, and threw him into a dungeon in
one of his castles, where he died of ill-treatment, and then
John denied Christian burial to his body. This so delighted
Pope Martin, the rival of Benedict, that he conferred on John
the title of “Avenger of the Faith.” Jean was succeeded
by his son Gaston, who placed his sword at the disposal of
Charles VI. At Bordeaux with his aid the English underwent
a signal defeat. He was married to Eleanor of
Navarre, through whom the claim to the title of King of
Navarre came to her descendants. How that was, and the
crimes that brought it about, must now be told.</p>

<p>Charles the Noble, King of Navarre, died in 1425. Having
lost his only son, he bequeathed crown and kingdom to his
daughter Blanche, married to Juan of Aragon, brother of
Alphonso, King of Aragon and the Two Sicilies, and by reversion
after her death to their son Charles, Prince of Viana.
Juan of Aragon acted as viceroy to his brother whilst Alphonso
was in Italy. On the death of Charles the Noble
Juan and Blanche assumed the titles of King and Queen of
Navarre. Blanche died in 1441, and by her will bequeathed
the kingdom, in accordance with her father’s desire, to her
son Charles of Viana. But Juan had no thought of surrendering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the crown to his son. He married a young, handsome,
and ambitious woman, Juana Henriquez, daughter of the
Admiral of Castille, and she became the mother of Ferdinand,
afterwards known as “the Catholic.” Thenceforth she
schemed to obtain all that could be grasped for her own son
Ferdinand.</p>

<p>Charles was an amiable, accomplished youth, fond of
literature and of the arts. Queen Blanche, in her will, had
urged him not to assume the government without the consent
of his father; but when, in 1452, the estates of Aragon
recognized him as heir to the crown, and Juan declined to
resign, Charles openly raised the standard of revolt. Juan
marched against his son, and Charles was defeated, taken
prisoner, and consigned to a fortress. There he remained
for a year, and would have remained on indefinitely had not
the Navarrese armed for his deliverance. Juan was forced
to yield, and as a compromise confirmed Charles in the principality
of Viana, and promised to abandon to him half the
royal revenues.</p>

<p>The reconciliation thus forcibly effected was not likely to
last; in fact, the compromise suited neither party. The
father burned to chastise sharply his rebellious son, and
Charles chafed at being defrauded of the crown which was
his undoubted heritage. Hence in 1455 both prepared to
renew the contest. The following year, 1456, the prince was
again defeated by his father, and was compelled to fly to his
uncle Alphonso, who was then at Naples. During his absence
Juan summoned the estates and declared that both
Charles and his eldest daughter Blanche were excluded from
succession to the throne&mdash;Charles on account of his rebellion,
Blanche for having espoused his cause&mdash;and Juan proclaimed
his youngest daughter Leonora to be his heir. Blanche had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
been married to, and then separated from, Henry the Impotent,
King of Castille. Leonora was married to the Count
of Foix.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Pampeluna, and the people generally
throughout Navarre, were indignant at the injustice committed
by Juan; they elected Charles to be their king,
and invited him to ascend the throne. Unfortunately for
him, Alphonso, King of Aragon and the Two Sicilies, died in
1458, whereupon Juan ascended the throne that had been
occupied by his brother. Charles now hoped for a reconciliation,
which he had reason to expect, as his father now
wore three crowns which had come to him by right; and he
hoped that Juan would readily surrender to him that of
Navarre, which he had usurped, and to which he had no
legitimate claim. The Prince of Viana landed in Spain in
1459, and dispatched a messenger to Juan entreating him
to forget the past and to recognize his claim to Navarre
at present and his right to succession to Aragon. But Juan
would allow nothing further than restoration to the principality
of Viana, and expressly forbade his son setting foot
in Navarre. Had the misunderstanding ended here, it had
been well for Charles; but a new occasion of dispute arose.</p>

<p>Henry IV of Castille offered his sister Isabella, heiress to
the crown after his death, to Charles of Viana. This alarmed
and enraged Juana, the stepmother of Charles, who calculated
on effecting this alliance for her own son Ferdinand, and
uniting under his sceptre the kingdoms of Aragon and Castille.
To obtain this end Charles must be got rid of. Accordingly
she induced his father Juan to invite him to a conference at
Lerida. The prince went thither unsuspiciously, and was at
once arrested and thrown into prison. The Estates of Aragon
and Catalonia were incensed at the harsh and unjust treatment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
of one whom they hoped eventually to proclaim as
their sovereign. They demanded his liberation. The King
refused. Insurrection broke out, became general, and so
menacing that Queen Juana was alarmed and herself solicited
the release of the Prince. She did more; she went in person
to Morella, whither the captive had been transferred, to open
the prison gates. He was conducted by her to Barcelona,
which admitted him, but shut its gates in her face. All
Catalonia now recognized the Prince, and proclaimed him
heir to the thrones of Aragon, Navarre, and Sicily. But the
rejoicing of the people was of brief duration, as shortly after
his release from durance Charles fell ill, lingered a few days,
and died. By his testament he bequeathed the crown of
Navarre to his sister Blanche as next in order of succession
to himself.</p>

<p>The death of Charles was too opportune for it not to have
been attributed to poison, administered by an agent of his
stepmother. Soon after a ray of sunlight focussed by a
mirror set fire to Juana’s hair. This was at once set
down as a Judgment of Heaven falling on her, an indication
by the finger of God that she was the murderess of her
stepson.</p>

<p>Charles was now out of the way; Blanche, however, obstructed
the path, and the will of her brother in her favour
proved fatal to her. Juan was resolved to retain the sovereignty
of Navarre during his own life, and none the less to
transmit it at death to his favourite daughter Leonora,
Countess of Foix, or her issue. He determined to compel
Blanche to renounce her rights. To effect this she was sent
across the Pyrenees, closely guarded, under the pretext that
she was about to be given in marriage to the Duke of Berri,
brother of the French king. But she perceived clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
enough what was her father’s purpose, and at Roncevaux,
on her way, she caused a protest to be prepared in all secrecy,
in which she declared that she was being carried out of Spain
by violence, against her will, and that force would be used
to compel her to renounce her rights over Navarre; and
now she declared beforehand against the validity of such a
renunciation. Upon reaching S. Jean-Pied-du-port, she was,
as she had anticipated, constrained to make a formal surrender
of all her rights, in favour of her sister and brother-in-law,
Gaston, Count of Foix. In a letter addressed to Henry,
couched in pathetic terms, she reminded him of the dawn
of happiness that she had enjoyed when united to him years
before, of his promises made to her, and of her subsequent
sorrows. As she was well aware that her father was consigning
her to imprisonment, and perhaps death at the hands
of her ambitious and unscrupulous sister, she conferred on
him all her rights to the crown of Navarre, to the exclusion
of those who meditated her assassination, the Count and
Countess of Foix. On the same day that this letter was
dispatched she was handed over to an emissary of the Countess
Leonora, 30 April, 1462, and was conveyed to the Castle of
Orthez. The gates closed on her, and she was seen no more,
but not long after they opened to allow a coffin to issue to
be conveyed to Lescar, there to be interred.</p>

<p>The secret of Blanche’s death was closely kept, till the
Navarrese Cortes took the matter up, and demanded her
release as their rightful queen. Then only was it announced
that she was dead, but on what day and in what manner
she died was never revealed.</p>

<p>The Count and Countess of Foix now congratulated themselves
on having secured the crown of Navarre to themselves
and to their descendants, and their son Gaston was at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
invested with the title of Prince of Viana. But the crime
committed brought but a barren gain. A few years later
Gaston of Viana, their hope, was killed by a lance in a tournament
at Lillebourne. Count Gaston never obtained the
kingdom, and died at Roncevaux in 1472. His widow,
Leonora, was balked to the very last. Her father retained
the title of King and the rule over Navarre up to his death
in 1479, and when the coveted diadem fell to her, she retained
it but for fifteen days, and then died also. Her grandson,
Francis, called Phœbus on account of his beauty, was indeed
crowned at Pampeluna. He was a gallant and amiable
boy, but the doom of the ill-gotten crown was on him. Ferdinand
the Catholic, son of the wicked Joanna, would not
allow a pretty boy to stand in his way. One day, 29 January,
1483, after dinner, the prince, <i>adonné à toutes gentillesses</i>, took
a flute on which he was wont to play. Scarcely had he raised
it to his lips ere he turned deadly white and sank into a chair.
In two hours he was dead, at the age of sixteen. As he lay
dying he turned to his mother with a smile and said, “My
kingdom is not of this world.”</p>

<p>It was the conviction of all contemporaries that Ferdinand
the Catholic had contrived to have the lad poisoned.</p>

<p>The claim to the crown of Navarre now passed to Catherine,
the sister of Francis Phœbus, married to Jean d’Albret.
This marriage is interesting. It was determined by the
Estates of Béarn. No sooner was Francis Phœbus dead
than Ferdinand of Castille, his supposed murderer, sent to
demand the hand of Catherine for his son, a child in the cradle.
But the mother, Magdalen of France, coldly replied that the
choice of a husband for her daughter was a matter for decision
by the Assembly of the delegates of Béarn. The Estates
were convoked to Pau, and the majority voted for Jean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
d’Albret, whose lands adjoined Béarn, and who was himself
then but a child. During the infancy of Catherine and Jean
d’Albret Magdalen acted as regent. The Count of Grammont
and others formed a plot to poison her in favour of Jean de
Foix, Catherine’s uncle. It was discovered, and the minor
conspirators were executed at Pau; the instigators, being
grandees, escaped scot-free.</p>

<p>Catherine, on growing to woman’s estate, left no stone
unturned in her attempt to obtain the kingdom of Navarre,
but feebly supported by her amiable husband. “Would
that I had been born John and you Catherine!” exclaimed
the impetuous princess; “and then we would have secured
Navarre.” In the end Catherine died of disappointment at
the failure of all her schemes, and in dying turned her eyes in
the direction of Navarre.</p>

<p>The rest of the story of the viscounts of Béarn, counts of
Foix, and titular kings of Navarre, shall be told when we
come to Pau.</p>

<p>By some fatality, surely unjustly, the Gascons are credited
throughout France with being braggarts, cowards, the
makers of bad bulls and as bad jokes. This is what a writer
says of them in <i>Le Passe-temps Agréable</i>, Rotterdam, 1737:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If in France you would speak of a braggart and swash-buckler,
whose magnanimity and courage are discoverable in
his speech, and in his speech alone; who speaks of war, without
having been in it; say but, He is a Gascon, and this explains
everything. Those friends at the table who are faithful so
long as it is spread with good cheer, but who vanish when the
platter and the beaker are empty&mdash;say that they are Gascons,
and that explains all. Should you encounter a fellow who
boasts of his gallantries and the favours he has received from
fair ladies, intimate that he is a Gascon, and all will know the
worth of his statements. The word Gascon suffices to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span> comprehend
various characters never estimable. But it must not be
supposed that all Gascons are such sorry creatures as those
spoken of above. There are to be found among them men of
rare merit, and men with plenty of courage, men as honest as
are any others. But, actually, all Gascons do not come from
Gascony. Every nation under the sun breeds its braggarts
and false braves. ‘The true Gascons,’ says a writer who knew
them well in their own land washed by the Garonne, ‘the true
Gascons possess a good deal of heart, and are desirous of making
all the world aware of the fact.’ But I am not satisfied that
they do not make display of more heart than they actually
possess.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A collection of bons-mots and blunders made by Gascons
is found in <i>Vasconia</i>, Lyons, 1730. The description of a
Gascon, as given by a fellow-countryman, is more flattering
than that above. He says: “To be a Gascon is to be a
happy mixture of dazzling virtues and of agreeable and convenient
faults. Everything in us is charming, even our imperfections.
What if there be blemishes perceptible in us?
There are spots in the sun itself.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Michelet</span>, with florid eloquence, describes the approach
to the Pyrenees from Bordeaux in the first chapter of
the second volume of his <i>History of France</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“However beautiful and fertile may be the valley of the
Garonne, one cannot lag there. The distant summits of the
Pyrenees exercise on us a too powerful attraction. But it is
a serious matter to reach them. Whether you take the way
by Nérac, a doleful <i>seigneurie</i> of the Albrets, or whether you
follow the coast, it is all the same, you must either traverse or
skirt an ocean of <i>landes</i>, covered with cork trees and vast pine
forests, where nothing is met save black sheep under the conduct
of a shepherd of the department, that have left the mountains
for the plains in quest of warmth. The roving life of
these shepherds is one of the most picturesque elements in the
South. These nomads, companions of the stars in their
eternal solitude, half astronomers, half sorcerers, carry their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
goods with them. Here in the West they continue to lead the
Asiatic life of Lot and Abraham.</p>

<p>“The formidable barrier of Spain now rises before us in all
its majesty. The Pyrenees are not, like the Alps, a complicated
system of peaks and valleys, they are simply a mighty
wall that drops to lower elevations at its extremities. Two
peoples, distinct from one another&mdash;the Basques at the west,
the Catalans at the east&mdash;hold the doors of two worlds. These
irritable and capricious porters open and shut at will, wearied
and impatient at the incessant passage of the nations through
these ports. They opened to Abderaman, they shut to
Roland. Many graves lie between Roncevaux and the Seu
d’Urgel.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Certain it is that the approach to the Pyrenees across the
long level of the Landes lends to them an advantage only
possessed by the Alps when seen from the plains of Lombardy.
I know nothing so impressive as the scene from a swell on
the surface of the Landes, when the eye sees the great range
in silver and cobalt stretching to the south from a dim east,
in which snowy peaks and silver clouds are indistinguishable,
to die away beyond the reach of the eye in the west, and all
beheld over a vast sheet of dark green forest, like a sea stretching
to their roots. Nowadays we whirl from Bordeaux to
Dax and Bayonne by rail. I recall the journey by carriage,
when before our eyes for two days we saw that blue ridge
tipped with silver half-way up the sky, hour after hour becoming
more distinct. I have spoken of the colours of the
mountains as cobalt and silver. So they are in the remote
distance, but when near at hand the tints are richer. I had
a drawing-master at Bayonne, to whom I showed some
water-colour sketches of English scenery. He shook his
head. “Cobalt!” said he; “that will not do for the
shadows of our Pyrenees. For them you must employ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
ultramarine and carmine.” He spoke the truth. Such are
the royal purples of Pyrenean shadows worn in summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>Bayonne is a trefoil. There are three towns, but the third
is on the north side of the Adour, and in the department of
Landes. It has grown up about the railway station and the
citadel. Old Bayonne is a city planted on both banks of
the Nive, where it joins the Adour. Bayonne is the capital
of the Basque country, and the population of the town is
composed of Basques, Spaniards, Jews, with a sprinkling
only of French. The cathedral, the old castle, the Mairie,
and the theatre are in Grand Bayonne on the left bank of
the Nive. In Petit Bayonne, on the right bank, are the
arsenal, the Châteaux Neuf, and the military hospital.</p>

<p>The old town, cramped within its fortifications, capable
of expansion upwards only, has narrow and gloomy
streets.</p>

<p>The cathedral was left incomplete by the English when
driven out of Bayonne. It lacked a west front and towers;
but these have been supplied of late years. Externally the
cathedral is not striking, but within it is well-proportioned.
Choir and apse pertain to the thirteenth century, the nave
to the fourteenth, all constructed when the English were
masters of the town. The arms of England, of Talbot, and
other noble families that are English, are emblazoned on the
keys of the vaulting ribs. On the south side of the church
are the beautiful cloisters, almost the largest in France.
Their date is 1240.</p>

<div id="if_p32" class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;"><img src="images/p032.jpg" width="465" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL, BAYONNE</div></div>

<p>A good many houses in the town have cellars vaulted
with ribs to a key, and on some of these latter are English
arms. But few old buildings in the town are of interest.
The château dates from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and the new château is of the fifteenth and sixteenth, but
neither is architecturally remarkable.</p>

<p>Bayonne and Bordeaux were warmly attached to England
during the three hundred years that they pertained to the
English crown. Their love was not altogether sentimental;
it sprang out of self-interest, as these two ports furnished the
wine that was supplied to Britain and Ireland. Our kings
did what they could to attach the citizens to their crown by
the grant of extensive privileges, and undoubtedly Bayonne
reached its greatest prosperity when under the sceptre of
England. This prosperity roused the jealousy of the commercial
ports of Normandy, especially was this the case
when that duchy was detached from the English crown.
To avenge the death of a Rouen merchant killed in an affray
in Bayonne the Normands attacked and butchered a whole
ship’s crew that had entered one of their ports. On another
occasion they surprised sixty-two Bayonnais merchant vessels
in the port of S. Malo, and hung from the yardarm one of the
crew of each side by side with dogs. This latter insult was
more keenly felt by the Bayonnais than the execution itself.
They appealed to Edward I “against these bad persons who
have put your subjects to death, hanging mastiffs alongside
of Christians, in defiance of Christianity and of your Majesty,
and of your subjects.”</p>

<p>The outrage had to be chastised. Large armaments
were equipped on both sides, and in one engagement the
Normands lost five thousand men. The grim joke with the
dogs proved costly to them in the end.</p>

<p>But at the close of the thirteenth century these petty
quarrels between rival cities were merged in the general war
that raged between England and France. Philip the Fair
got possession of Bayonne in 1294. Edward I hastened into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Gascony, besieged the town, retook it, and thenceforth the
leopards of England waved from their battlements till July,
1451, when the English were expelled from Bayonne by Charles
VII. The Bayonnais watched the entry of the French with
sullen dissatisfaction, and were only consoled for the change
of master by a miracle. A luminous white cross appeared in
the sky, and this led them to suppose that Heaven had decreed
that the white cross of France should take the place of
the red cross of England. Bayonne has given its name to
the bayonet, which was invented there about the year 1647.
Originally it was a dagger with a round handle that fitted
into the bore of a gun, and was fixed only after the soldier
had discharged his piece. The use of the bayonet fastened
on to the barrel was an improvement introduced by the
French. In the battle of Marsaglia in 1693 the success of
the French was mainly due to the employment of this
weapon. The enemy were unable to stand against so formidable
a novelty.</p>

<p>In 1565 the queen-mother, Catherine de Medici, here met
her daughter, Isabella of Spain, who had just recovered
from a severe illness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Political motives were not forgotten, and among other
matters to be considered between the sovereigns of France and
Spain&mdash;for Catherine hoped that Philip would accompany his
wife&mdash;was undoubtedly the repression of heresy. There exists
among the state papers at Simancas what is called by diplomatists
an ‘identical note’ of the subjects to be discussed at
Bayonne. In it we read that the two powers engaged not to
tolerate the Reformed worship in their respective states, that
the canons of the Council of Trent should be enforced, that all
nonconformists should be incapacitated for any public office,
civil or military, and that heretics should quit the realm within
a month, permission being accorded them to sell their property.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Although Catherine gave her assent to these declarations, so
far as the discussion of them was concerned, we have indisputable
evidence that she did not intend to adopt them in
the same sense as Philip of Spain.”<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> White (H.), <i>The Massacre of S. Bartholomew</i>. London, 1868.</p></div>

<p>It has been supposed that on this occasion the massacre
of S. Bartholomew was planned. Such, however, was not
the case. Catherine at the time was indisposed to adopt
violent measures. She sought to hold the balance between
the contending parties. Moreover, the massacre did not take
place till seven years later. The meeting at Bayonne in
1565 was rather one of rejoicing, with a series of magnificent
fêtes, and political business was transacted only at odd
moments. Some years later, when Walsingham referred to
this Bayonne meeting as the occasion of an inauguration of
a general league against the Protestants, Catherine replied
that it had no such result at all, and that it “tended to no
other end but to make good cheer.”</p>

<p>One of the masques performed on this occasion was a representation
of “Wild Scotchmen.” The Duke of Guise and
six others were equipped in what was fondly believed to be
the Highland costume. Over a white satin shirt embroidered
with gold lace and crimson silk they wore a jacket of
yellow velvet, with short skirts closely plaited “according
to the custom of these savages,” trimmed with a border of
crimson satin, ornamented with gold, silver, pearls, and other
jewels of various colours. Their yellow satin hose were
similarly adorned, and their silk boots were trimmed with
silver fringe and rosettes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On their heads they wore a cap <i>à l’antique</i> of cloth of gold,
and for crest a thunderbolt pouring out a fragrant jet of perfumed
fire&mdash;the said thunderbolt being twined round by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
serpent reposing on a pillow of green satin. Each cavalier
wore on his arm a Scotch shield or targe covered with cloth of
gold and bearing a device. The horses’ trappings were of
crimson satin with plumes of yellow, white, and carnation.
So much for the Frenchman’s ideal of a Scotchman!”&mdash;White.</p></blockquote>

<p>We must pass on to the time of the First Empire, before
Bayonne became the scene of any political event of importance.</p>

<p>Napoleon had resolved on dethroning the King of Spain,
and on converting the peninsula into a kingdom for his brother
Joseph. The condition of affairs in Spain was favourable.
The King, Charles IV, was the feeblest of the fainéant race
of the Bourbons. He retained a tame confessor about his
person, for whom he would whistle when he was conscious of
a twinge of conscience. The Queen, Louisa Maria of Parma,
had made a paramour of Manuel Godoy, a lusty private in
the Guards. Him she created Prince of the Peace and Prime
Minister. His power over her and over the mind of the poor
King was complete.</p>

<p>The Infante, the Prince Ferdinand, was also feeble-minded.
He was the rallying point of the faction opposed to Godoy.
Ferdinand appealed by letter to Napoleon (11 October,
1807), and the Emperor at once, through his agent Savary
at Madrid, pressed him to throw himself on his protection
by coming to Bayonne, “where,” said Savary, “you will
hear him salute you as Ferdinand VII, King of Spain and
the Indies.” The stupid Bourbon prince walked into the
trap. On 16 April, 1808, he crossed the frontier. “Ha!
is the fool actually come!” exclaimed Napoleon, who was at
Bayonne. “I could hardly have thought it possible.”</p>

<p>Napoleon received him graciously, but instead of hailing
him as king, endeavoured to induce him voluntarily to resign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
his pretensions to the throne. But Ferdinand, though
stupid, was stubborn, and he refused. It was accordingly
necessary for the Emperor to ensnare the old king as well.
He wrote to him and to the Queen, inviting them to Bayonne
so that he might settle the dispute between him and the Infante,
in order to place the throne of Charles beyond danger
of usurpation by Ferdinand. The King was also dull enough
to walk into the snare.</p>

<p>On 30 April a huge, lumbering coach drawn by eight
Biscayan mules rolled over the drawbridge of Bayonne. It
contained the monarch, his queen, his youngest son, and some
attendants. Two other antiquated chariots discharged
their cargoes of chamberlains and ladies-in-waiting. Godoy,
who had preceded the royal party, welcomed it, and assured
his sovereign that the intentions of the Emperor towards him
were most generous. This assurance was speedily corroborated
by Napoleon, who appeared in person. The childish
king threw himself, weeping, into the arms of Napoleon,
and called him his best friend and truest support.</p>

<p>As the infirm old man was unable to walk unassisted,
Napoleon took him under the arm to help him up the steps.
Charles turned to the Queen and said, “See, Louisa, he is
sustaining me!”</p>

<p>The resentment of the old couple against their son had
increased. Ferdinand was summoned to their presence
before Napoleon, and then ensued a scene to which the Emperor
afterwards looked back with disgust. The King
loaded his son with bitter reproaches, the Queen broke out
into invectives. Losing all command over herself, this royal
virago foamed at the mouth, called on her good friend the
Emperor to send him to the guillotine, and had the indecency
to protest that this son, though borne by her, had not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
King for his father. Then the old king, crippled with rheumatism,
raised his shaking hand over the prince and threatened
him with his cane.</p>

<p>The main quarrel between the King and Ferdinand was
due to Charles having abdicated when a riot broke out in
Madrid and Ferdinand having been proclaimed. But
Charles afterwards revoked his abdication, which had been
wrung from him by his terrors, and Ferdinand refused to
withdraw his claim to having succeeded his father on the
surrender of the crown by the old man. After the deplorable
scene described, Ferdinand gave way so far as to consent to
resign the crown, on condition that this renunciation was in
favour of his father only, and that it was ratified in Madrid.
This did not satisfy Napoleon; it was not what he wanted.</p>

<p>At this juncture Marbot, the aide-de-camp of Murat, who
had been sent to Madrid, arrived at full gallop to announce
to the Emperor that an insurrection had broken out in the
capital, in consequence of an attempt made to remove the
remaining members of the royal family.</p>

<p>This furnished Napoleon with the excuse he wanted.
“Unless,” said he to Ferdinand, whom he accused of having
provoked the riot, “unless between this and midnight you
have recognized your father as king, and have sent information
to this effect to Madrid, I will have you dealt with as a rebel.”</p>

<p>The terrified prince yielded. On 6 May Ferdinand signed
a formal renunciation of the crown. But on the previous
day Charles had been induced also to surrender his claims.
Ferdinand in return was to have the palace of Navarre
and an income of six hundred thousand francs; Charles
was accorded the châteaux of Chambord and Compiègne.
The despised and disinherited princes were to receive in all
ten millions; “but,” as Napoleon wrote, “we will reimburse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
ourselves out of Spain!” Yet even this undertaking was
not observed. Ferdinand was interned in France.</p>

<p>The stretch of country from Bayonne to the frontier is
full of interest to the Englishman as the scene of the contest
between Wellington and Soult, after the former had driven
the French over the frontier and out of Spain.</p>

<p>The autumn of 1813 had been passed by the greater part
of the allied army of English, Portuguese, and Spaniards
under canvas on the cold and cloudy summits of the Western
Pyrenees. They endured great privations. Their picket
and night duties were incessant and harassing; the weather,
moreover, was stormy. The tedium of these camps, and the
sufferings from frost and sleet, exhausted the patience and
shook the constancy of the soldiers of weakest fibre.</p>

<p>But the fall of Pampeluna released the army on the
Pyrenees from its inactivity. It was known that Marshal
Soult had prepared a defensive position on the Nivelle stretching
from ten to twelve miles from the sea at S. Jean de Luz
to the Petite Rhune before the village of Sare.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight, on the morning of 10 November,
the columns of the allies under Wellington wound down the
passes of the mountains in silence, lighted by the moon. At
earliest dawn the attack was made on the lines of the enemy,
and by sunset, in a succession of brilliant charges, the allies
had broken the line. Soult had been out-manœuvred and
out-fought on his own long-prepared ground, and beaten at
every point. The French, numbering seventy thousand men,
had been placed in carefully selected positions. Strongly
entrenched, they knew the roads, and were fighting to protect
their native land from invasion; yet they suffered themselves
to be dislodged from every point assailed with a lack
of spirit that surprised the allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Under cover of night Soult withdrew and concentrated
his forces in front of Bayonne. Wellington took up a position
within two miles of the enemy, his left resting on the sea and
his right on Cambo. As the weather was stormy and wet,
all operations ceased. The roads were execrable, the crossroads
a quagmire. It was not possible at that time of the
year to move artillery over the sodden ground, and even communication
between the wings was difficult.</p>

<p>Sir Rowland Hill on the right crossed the Nive at Cambo,
and the French in front of him fell back on Bayonne; he
then occupied the heights of Villefranche. The forces of the
allies were disposed in a semicircle, their communications
intersected by a river, and made difficult by the muddy roads.
The position of the French was central, with short and easy
communications, and was supported by the guns of the
fortress. Soult could fling himself with all his weight on
any point where the allies were weakest in his estimation,
and that before they could bring up reinforcements. This,
in fact, is what he did. On 10, 11, and 12 December, the
Marshal directed repeated attacks on Sir John Hope on the
left; but met with no success. Then hastily passing through
the town with his main force, on the night of the 12th, he
hurled thirty thousand men against the position held by
Sir Rowland Hill on the British right. Sir Rowland mustered
but thirteen thousand men, British and Portuguese.
The French columns advanced steadily, disregarding the
crushing bullets of a well-served artillery, the grape and
the musketry of the light troops. They were gaining ground
by sheer weight of numbers, when the reserve advanced,
arriving from the centre, and the French were beaten back
with terrible slaughter, all Bayonne looking on from the
ramparts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
The battle was fought by Sir Rowland Hill with his own
corps, unassisted. Wellington did not arrive on the field
until the victory was won.</p>

<p>Soult now strongly garrisoned Bayonne, and withdrew
along the road to Orthez and Pau, in order to defend the latter.
Wellington followed him, but not until the close of January,
and he left Sir John Hope to watch Bayonne. It was necessary
for this gallant officer to cross the Adour, as the citadel
was on the right bank. The river was three hundred yards
wide at the point selected, one where a bend in its course
concealed it from the view of the garrison of Bayonne.</p>

<p>“At one in the morning of 23 January Sir John Hope
marched from his cantonments to direct and support this
movement. The pontoons were unavoidably delayed by the
depth and softness of the sandy road, therefore the design of
sending a detachment across the river before daylight was defeated.
However, the attention of the garrison was entirely
occupied by the lively demonstrations upon their entrenched
camp. Sir John Hope determined to commence passing the
river as soon as ever a few boats and pontoons could be launched.
Owing to light and baffling winds the bridge flotilla had not
arrived off the bar. The pontoons from Bidart did not accomplish
their march in the time expected, and at noon four
jolly-boats and five pontoons, which the men took on their
shoulders and carried over the sand-hills, were the only means
of passage at the disposal of the general. To protect the launch
of these boats some field guns were moved forward. At sight
of the troops the enemy’s picket retired without firing a shot,
and walked leisurely to the citadel. Fifty men were instantly
rowed over to the right bank. A hawser was stretched across
the river, the five pontoons were formed into rafts, and a detachment
of the Guards was ferried over. When about 600
men had been put across, the tide flowed so strong that the
rafts could no longer work; and, save a few sent over in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
jolly-boats, the passage of troops ceased. At this time only
six companies of the Guards, two of the 60th Rifles, and a
small party of the rocket corps, had been passed to the right
bank. All seemed quiet in their front; when, suddenly, about
five o’clock in the evening, two columns issued from the citadel
to attack this detachment. Colonel Stopford, in command,
drew up his troops in a position that secured his flanks, and
enabled him to avail himself of the support of the guns on the
opposite bank. His right rested on the Adour, his left on a
morass. The artillery could sweep his front with a defensive
fire, and he judiciously placed his rocket men on each flank.
The French had nearly 1500 men, and advanced to the attack
with some show of resolution; when the rockets opened on them,
and being well directed, swept through their ranks with so
rushing a sound, and so destructive an effect, that the novelty
startled and appalled them. They seemed paralyzed with
astonishment, and a few quickly following discharges of the
ground-rockets drove them back in haste and fear. More men
were crossed over in the night at slack water; and on the following
evening the first division, two guns, and a squadron of
dragoons, were established on the right bank.”<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></p></blockquote>

1832.</p></div>

<p>The flotilla appeared off the Adour on the morning of the
25th, the bar was successfully passed, thirty-four <i>chasse-marées</i>
were brought into position, and anchored head and
stern upon the line selected; the sappers worked all night,
and by noon next day a solid bridge was laid down. Troops
and artillery now filed over it, and the citadel of Bayonne
was invested.</p>

<p>Upon the morning of 14 April the governor of the citadel
made a furious sortie upon the investing corps, which was
wholly unprepared for the attack, as peace had been declared,
and Bonaparte had abdicated on 5 April. The news had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
reached Bayonne; the commandant of the citadel was well
aware of it, but could not resist the treacherous attempt to
retrieve his laurels by catching the British unprepared.</p>

<p>His assault was repulsed, with the loss of 830 men to the
British, and with the capture of Sir John Hope, who was
wounded. The French attack was supported by the fire of
the gunboats on the river, which opened indiscriminately
on friend and foe. The French lost 910 men.</p>

<p>The cemetery where our gallant fellow-countrymen lie who
thus fell is on the edge of the Landes, on the north side of the
Adour. When Queen Victoria visited Biarritz, as also recently
when King Edward VII was there, this cemetery was duly
visited by both monarchs. No one who remains any length
of time in Bayonne should omit a visit to the beautiful lakes
that lie embosomed in cork woods and pine forests in the
Landes, in the abandoned course of the Adour. The river,
instead of entering the sea where it does now, formerly turned
north, and had its mouth at Cape Breton, something like
ten miles distant. But at the close of the fourteenth century
a violent tempest blowing from the west threw up a barrier
of sand and blocked the mouth of the Adour, which then
pursued its course northward, and finally discharged its waters
into the Atlantic at Vieux-Boucau, and that remained its
mouth for two centuries. But in 1579 the inhabitants of
Bayonne, aided by a flood, managed to pierce the isthmus of
sand-hills which separated their town from the sea, and thus
created a new mouth for the river. The Adour, however,
pours into the bay in a contrary direction to the prevailing
winds, consequently there is an incessant struggle going on
there between the current and the waves, resulting in a deposit
of mud, sand, and pebble, and the building up of a bar
which the sea is incessantly driving towards the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
whereas the river is as incessantly engaged in repelling it.
The existence of this bar makes the entrance to the Adour
difficult and even dangerous, and has necessitated expensive
works.</p>

<p>The lakes in the Landes are a haunt of wild fowl, and
afford good fishing.</p>

<p>Biarritz needs little more than a mention, though a place of
some antiquity. It is spoken of in the eleventh century,
when some Basques harpooned a whale in the Bay of Biscay.
It throve on the whale fishery, and so wealthy did it become
that the tithe of its revenue constituted the principal source
of the income of the bishops of Bayonne. In course of time
the whales abandoned the coast and migrated to the north,
and then the prosperity of Biarritz declined, and it sank to
being an insignificant fishing village, till the Empress Eugénie
took a fancy to it, and a new era of prosperity began. It is
now a fashionable resort, especially for Spanish nobles. The
heaths around in early summer are lovely with the intensely
blue <i>Lithospermum</i>, and the crimson <i>Daphne cneorum</i>.</p>

<p>Visitors to Biarritz make an expedition to the “Refuge,”
distant about three miles, over a heath. The Abbé Céstac
had founded an orphanage at Bayonne for girls, and had
placed it under the charge of the Servantes de Marie. Not
content with this good work he gathered about him a number
of penitents and lodged them in the attics of the orphanage.
Then in 1839 he bought a little property near Biarritz,
and moved his penitents to it and placed them under the control
of his sister Madelaine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Complete isolation, absolute silence, total abstinence from
flesh meat, manual labour in the garden and graveyard, constant
prayer in the church, or meditation in their cells, constitute
their rule of life. Like the Trappists, their bed is a hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
board, to which they retire at eight in the evening to rise at
four in the morning. On Friday they take a meal which serves
for dinner&mdash;unseasoned vegetables&mdash;on their knees. They
never read a book, except one of devotion, and are entirely
ignorant of the politics and changes of society. This holy
Thebaid is shut out from all view of the external world;
neither ocean nor river, nor plain nor hill, can be discerned from
it, although Nature, immediately outside its limits, presents
herself in her loveliest aspects of sea and mountain. Unbroken
silence and solitude prevail, and the stranger who
enters its sacred seclusion becomes involuntarily overpowered
by the sentiment that pervades the atmosphere and fills the
mind with awe and wonder.”<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> Lawlor, <i>Pilgrimages in the Pyrenees</i>. London, 1870.</p></div>

<p>I should add, with indignation that human beings, even
penitents, should be reduced by this method to stultification.</p>

<p>S. Jean de Luz is a favourite bathing place for such as
desire more quiet and less heavy hotel charges than Biarritz
affords. In 1660 the church saw the marriage of Louis XIV
and Maria Theresa, Infanta of Spain. In commemoration
of this event, the magistrates walled up the door by which
the bridal pair passed out, and it has remained thus shut to
this day. At S. Jean de Luz may be seen what is usual in
Basque and Béarnais churches, as also in Tyrol, the men
occupying the galleries, not infrequently in double tiers,
whilst the women fill the body of the church. In the Maison
Lobobiagne, with turrets, lodged Louis XIV; the Infanta
and her mother, Anne of Austria, occupied the Maison
Joanoëna.</p>

<p>I can recall rides <i>en cacolet</i> as customary among the Basques
some sixty years ago, now quite obsolete. A horse was
furnished with two baskets, one on each side, and two persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
were accommodated, one in each basket. Inglis says in
1835:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Morning, noon, and evening, the road between Bayonne
and Biarritz is crowded with travellers <i>en cacolet</i>. The horses
belong generally to the women who drive them; these women
are generally young, many of them handsome. They generally
speak French, Basque, and a little Spanish, and are rather intelligent
than otherwise, always carrying on an unintermitting
conversation during the whole ride. The horses are usually
indifferent; they go at a small trot, and perform the <i>trajet</i> in
about forty minutes.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most puzzling facts in the study of mankind
is the manner in which the most unmeaning customs are
found extended far and wide. I shall have something to say
of the <i>couvade</i> in another chapter. There is another which
is met with in the Basque country, and which is also, or was,
usual in Yorkshire. On Easter Monday the girls seize on
lads and heave them up in the air, and hold them aloft till
they redeem themselves with a coin or a kiss. On Tuesday
the boys enjoy the same privilege with the girls. I have been
so lifted up near Bayonne. I recall an instance in Yorkshire,
where H.M. Inspector of Schools, a grave and reverend
signor, came to a manufacturing town on Easter Monday.
As he was sedately walking from the station he encountered
a bevy of mill lasses, when at once he was uplifted by
them and carried in triumph, in vain expostulating,
and a kiss from him was demanded by each before he was
released.</p>

<p>So with April Fools’ Day&mdash;<i>le poisson d’avril</i>&mdash;it is honoured
in the same fashion in Hindustan as in Europe.</p>

<p>Few visitors to Biarritz fail to take a run over the frontier
into Spain. The Bidassoa for about twelve miles forms the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
line of demarcation between France and Spain. Near the
bridge of Behobia are the remains&mdash;they are nothing more&mdash;of
the Ile des Faisans, on which conferences were held between
Cardinal Mazarin, plenipotentiary for France, and Don Luis
da Haro, acting for Spain, which led to the conclusion of the
famous Treaty of the Pyrenees, in 1659, cemented by the
marriage of Louis XIV with the daughter of Philip IV.
At the meeting on the Ile des Faisans each party advanced
from its own territory by a temporary bridge to this patch
of neutral ground in mid-stream. The death of Velasquez,
the painter, was due to exposure whilst superintending the
decoration of the tent for the minister of Spain&mdash;a duty more
befitting an upholsterer than a great artist. By the treaty
France received la Cerdagne and Roussillon, but surrendered
Lorraine to Duke Charles IV, on condition that he should
dismantle all its fortresses. As he delayed doing this Louis
retained his hold on the duchy.</p>

<p>Fontarabie (Fuenterrabia) does not signify the Fountain
of Arabia, and retains in its name no reminiscence of Moorish
domination; the derivation is from the Latin <i>fons rapidus</i>.
It is a picturesque, dirty town, malodorous; bearing as its
arms in quarterings an angel holding a key, to signify that the
town holds the key of Spain&mdash;a squalid beggar would be
more appropriate than an angel; a whale and two syrens,
the whale to indicate the fishing of the leviathan, now long
departed; and lastly a castle between two stars. These
arms were accorded to Fuenterrabia by Philip IV in 1638,
when the admiral of Castile repulsed the Prince of Condé,
who was besieging it. The church, Gothic in style, has been
modernized externally; within it is overloaded with barbaric
ornament. The castle, known as the palace of Charles V,
dates originally from the tenth century, but has undergone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
much rebuilding and adaptation. The courtyard is picturesque,
and the terrace commands a beautiful view.</p>

<p>Fuenterrabia brings no pleasing remembrances to an
Englishman. The citizens begrudged a lodging to our sick
and wounded during the passage of the Pyrenees by the allied
troops under Wellington when in pursuit of Soult in the
depth of winter. The town authorities even wanted to take
away the boards on which were stretched the disabled soldiers.
“These,” wrote the Duke, “are the people to whom we
have given medicines, etc., whose wounded and sick we have
taken into our hospitals, and to whom we have rendered
every service in our power, after having recovered their
country from the enemy.”</p>

<p>Irun signifies in Basque “the good town,” but it contains
little that is good, nothing that is interesting. Passages, however,
will arrest the traveller, owing to its picturesque harbour,
land-locked, and the entrance commanded by the castles&mdash;reminding
a Devonshire man of Dartmouth. The port has
been neglected and suffered to be silted up, although the
rock-bound coast possesses no better harbour of refuge for
storm-tossed boats.</p>

<div id="if_p48" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p048.jpg" width="600" height="407" alt="" /><div class="caption">SAN SEBASTIAN</div></div>

<p>San Sebastian has suffered so severely from sieges that it
has lost its medieval character; but nothing can destroy
its natural beauty of situation. The Monte Urgull, on which
is the castle, was originally a rocky island, but it has been
united to the land by the deposits of the River Urumea, and
the town now occupies this neck. Beyond is the concha, a
semi-lunar bay, with excellent sands, and with the Isle of
Sta. Clara breaking the force of the waves that roll in from
the Atlantic. San Sebastian is the most fashionable seaside
resort in Spain, and is much frequented by the nobility
and by well-to-do citizens of Madrid. The church of S. Vincent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
is a Gothic edifice of 1507. San Sebastian is memorable
for its siege by Wellington. Mr. Ford <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was obtained in March, 1808, by Therenot, when the
French got in under false pretences. They held it during the
war, and being in the rear of the Duke when advancing in
1815 on the Pyrenees, it retarded his progress, and its possession
became absolutely necessary. This was a work of great
difficulty, for the naturally strong position was garrisoned by
3000 brave French veterans under General Rey, and the Duke,
from the usual neglect of our Government, in spite of repeated
applications to Lord Bathurst, was forced to wait from 25 July
to 26 August for want of means even to commence operations,
during which time the active enemy strengthened their defences,
being supplied from France by sea.</p>

<p>“In vain the Duke had warned Lord Melville, under whose
fatal rule the navy of England was first exposed to defeat, and
who now did his best to ensure a similar misfortune to the
army. And to make matters worse, Graham, to whom the
siege was entrusted, neglected the advice of Sir C. Felix Smith
and of Sir R. Fletcher. Graham having failed in a night attack
on 24 August, the Duke was forced to come in person to
set matters right. His arrival was, as usual, the omen of
victory. Now the town was assaulted as it ought to have
been at first, from the <i>chafres</i> or sand banks, and was taken on
31 August. The French, after a most gallant defence, retired to
the upper citadel, on which, by the almost superhuman efforts
of the engineers, backed by the bluejackets, guns were brought
to bear, and it surrendered on 9 September, two-thirds of the
valorous garrison having perished, while nearly 5000 English
troops were killed and wounded.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Wellington&mdash;then only the Marquess Wellesley&mdash;had not
bombarded the town, so as to spare the inhabitants, but
General Rey himself had set fire to the town on 22 July, as
is admitted by him in his own dispatch, and it was done for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the express purpose of hampering the progress of the English,
when he saw that the place must inevitably fall; and this,
when Wellington would not suffer his batteries to play upon
the town.</p>

<p>When finally San Sebastian was taken, all control over
the soldiers, who were exasperated by the stubborn resistance,
was for a while lost. A thunderstorm burst at the same
time that the soldiers broke in, and a scene of riot and rapine
ensued. In the midst of explosions of thunder and lightning
the city was sacked. Fires broke out in various places, and
flames waved over such houses as had been spared by Rey.
At the same time the garrison of the castle ploughed the
streets with their artillery, killing alike inhabitants flying
from the English, Spanish and Portuguese soldiery, as well
as the soldiers themselves. It was found impossible to extinguish
the flames or to control the soldiers. The most was
made of this. Napoleon wrote: “Les Anglais commettent
des horreurs dont les annales de la guerre offrent peu d’examples,
et dont cette nation barbare êtait seule capable dans un
siècle de civilisation.” But Napoleon never minced words.
The sack of San Sebastian, though regrettable, was mild in
comparison with the atrocities committed by the French
elsewhere in Spain. In justice it must be said that it was not
English alone who were guilty of these excesses, but the far
more lawless Spaniards and Portuguese who formed our
allies, and that the sack was stopped as soon as ever Wellington
was able to gain control over the maddened soldiery.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> the ridge of the Western Pyrenees descend four
large valleys towards the north, each with a river
running at the bottom. The westernmost and least important
is that of the Nivelet, that flows into the Bay of Biscay at
S. Jean de Luz. The second thence is the Nive, that discharges
its waters into the Adour at Bayonne. The third is the
Bidouze, which reaches the Adour just below where that
river receives the mingled waters of the two Gaves. The
last of these, and the easternmost of these rivers, is the
Cenon, that loses itself in the Gave of Oloron, near Sauveterre.</p>

<p>In the ancient geography of France these four valleys were
somewhat irregularly divided into districts, of which the
westernmost was called Labourde, and the easternmost
Soule, and the central portion was Lower Navarre. Taken
collectively these districts constitute the Basque land, the
population of which was closely related in language, habits,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and blood to the inhabitants of Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and
Upper Navarre in Spain. The narrow strip of land comprising
the two cantons of S. Palais and S. Jean-pied-de-Port
was for many centuries regarded as forming a parcel
of the province of Gascony, but Alphonso the Noble took it,
together with Labourde, from the English King John, so
that it became a portion of the kingdom of Navarre, though
Bayonne was recovered by the English. Sancho, King of
Navarre, strengthened his hold on it more firmly, but eventually,
when the claim to the crown of Navarre passed to the
Counts of Foix and Viscounts of Béarn, it was the sole portion
of that kingdom that these latter were able to retain, the
Spanish Navarre having been annexed by Ferdinand the
Catholic.</p>

<p>The Basques never obtained political independence. They
were always subjected to Frank or English domination;
they passed under the rule of the kings of Navarre and
counts of Foix, and finally under the crown of France. Nevertheless
they succeeded in maintaining a communal right of
self-government, and enjoyed great privileges, notably that
of conveying their wares and those of Spain free of duty to
the markets of Toulouse and Bordeaux; rights these that
awoke the jealousy of the citizens of Bayonne, who were
incessantly at feud with them. The Bayonnais claimed
Villefranche as belonging to Labourde, because the tide
flowed through the arches of the bridge there. In an affray
over this the mountaineers killed several citizens of Bayonne.
In reprisal, in the reign of Edward III of England, Duke of
Gascony and Aquitaine, the mayor of Bayonne, a Sieur de
Puyane, descended on Villefranche on S. Bartholomew’s
Day, when a fair was being held there, caught five burgesses
of note and fastened them to the arches of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
bridge, and let them drown to show by occular demonstration
that the tide did rise to Villefranche, and that therefore
it was within the jurisdiction of Bayonne. The Basques
rose <i>en masse</i> and massacred the Labourdins wherever they
caught them. Finally, both parties appealed to the arbitration
of the Sieur d’Albret, and the town of Bayonne was
condemned to pay a heavy sum as indemnity to the families
of the drowned men. The Bayonnais appealed to the
King of England. He mitigated the fine, but the Basques
would only consent to his adjudication on condition of
reserving the right to pursue the sons of the Sieur de
Puyane till they had exterminated the family. This was the
last act by which the Basque nation manifested its political
existence. But they retained their special privileges till the
French Revolution, when the common law of France superseded
all local independence of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Cambo is a pretty, pleasant place, that has of late years
risen to notice as a health resort. It takes its name from
what has been supposed to be an Euscaldunic, i.e. Basque
camp. I planned this and sent plan and description to the
Archæologia, in 1852. But with greater experience of ancient
camps than I had then, I have come to doubt whether it is
what has been supposed. It consists of a platform on a hillock
with a network of trenches about it, and ridges between
them sharp as the back of a knife. It may have been used
as a camp of refuge, but it could not contain a large force,
and the dykes around appear to have been formed by currents
of water.</p>

<p>Itxasson is an eminently Basque village. The church
contains rich ornaments of silver gilt for the altar, given in
the eighteenth century by an emigrant, Pedro d’Echegaray,
on his return from America, where he had realized a fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
The Basques, it may be noticed, do not give their names to
houses and farms, but assume as surnames those place names
from which they came.</p>

<p>From Itxasson the Pas de Roland is reached in half an
hour on foot. It is an archway bored in the crag beside the
river. Road and railway have so maltreated the rock that
the Pas is now hardly worth a special visit. It was through
this arch that the Roman road passed, and through it Roland
the Paladin went to his death at Roncevaux. According to
local legend Roland set his foot against the rock and burst
a way through it by pressure. Road and rail now enter the
mountains following the river.</p>

<p>At Bidarray, on the mountain-side, is a grotto, about thirty
feet deep. In one corner a ladder conducts to a cavity, at
the back of which is a stalagmitic incrustation three feet high,
of a livid hue, rudely representing a human torso. This is
held in high veneration by the peasantry, and is called “the
Saint of Bidarry,” though who the saint was whom it is supposed
to represent nobody can say. A very similar incrustation
occupies a niche in the Gorge of the Ardèche, and is there
held to be a lively presentation of Charlemagne. Sick people
seek this cave and soak rags in the water that dribbles from
the figure, and which has in fact built it up. They apply the
rags to the suffering parts of their bodies, and depart believing
themselves to be healed, but the rags are left behind
as <i>ex votos</i>.</p>

<p>S. Jean-Pied-de-Port was the key to the port or pass into
Spain, and especially to the communication between Upper
and Lower Navarre. It occupies a point where three streams
fall into the Nive. There had been a Gallo-Roman town
three miles distant at S. Jean-le-Vieux, but it had been
destroyed by the Saracens. The present town was founded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
by the Garcias, kings of Navarre, in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries. S. Jean, from the Treaty of the Pyrenees to the
Revolution, during three reigns, was the capital of French
Navarre. There are several old houses in the town, some
of the Renaissance Period, and owing to their being built
of red sandstone have a warm and pleasant aspect. The
citadel was constructed by Deville in 1668, but was remodelled
by Vauban, as were also the ramparts of the town.</p>

<p>The first book in Basque that was printed and published
was by Bernard d’Echepare, curé of S. Jean-Pied-de-Port,
in 1545. It consists of two parts. The first contains Christian
doctrine, moral sentences, and passages from Scripture,
good for edification. But strangely united with this, under
the same cover and with continuous numeration of pages,
is a collection of the priest’s erotic poems.</p>

<p>He frankly admits that he had had his love adventures.
“I would not go to heaven, not I,” he tells us, “unless I
were sure of meeting women there.”</p>

<p>He gives us a picture of female charms too highly coloured
to bear reproduction. He throws in episodes from his own
experience. In one of his escapades he got into such a scrape
that he was incarcerated by order of the king of Navarre.

<p>S. Jean-Pied-de-Port should be visited at the time of its

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
But should a visitor be there at midsummer he should
make an effort to push on to Pampeluna for the fête of
7 July, when for over a week the city keeps holiday&mdash;<i>les
gigantes</i> parade the streets, monstrous figures, representing
Moors; and the Alcalde and Corporation dance in front of
the cathedral in honour of S. Firmin, the patron saint. He
will, moreover, have an opportunity of seeing the pretty
Navarrese girls, who have come out of the country for the
great annual merry-making.</p>

<p>But the place of highest historic and romantic interest to
be visited from S. Jean-Pied-de-Port is Roncevaux. Here,
on 15 August, 778, the army of Charlemagne met with a
crushing defeat, in which Roland and the twelve peers of
the emperor were overwhelmed by rocks hurled down on them
by the Basques.</p>

<p>The contemporary Eginhard tells us that the king invaded
Spain at the head of a huge army, pushed on as far as Saragossa,
and there received hostages from the Saracen chiefs.
On his return, whilst entangled in the Pyrenean pass, the
Basques attacked his rearguard, which perished to a man.
Most of the officers of the palace, to whom Charlemagne had
confided the command of the troops, were among the slain,
and with them “Roland, prefect of the Marches of Brittany.”</p>

<p>No revenge could be taken for this disaster, as the light-footed
mountaineers dispersed, and could not be reached.
This is all we know for certain, but even in this account the
existence of Roland among the captains slain is doubtful,
as the passage referring to him is an interpolation, and is
not found in the best MSS. copies.</p>

<p>In 810 Louis “le Debonaire,” at that time King of Aquitaine,
on his return from an expedition into Spain, took the
precaution of securing the wives and children of the Basques<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and retaining them as hostages till he was safely through the
pass. But in 824 the Frank army descended to Pampeluna,
under two counts, and on its way back was surprised at
Roncevaux by the Basques; the troops were slaughtered
and the counts taken. These two disasters in popular tradition
were run into one, and gave occasion to the composition
of the “Song of Roland,” one of the finest pieces of medieval
poetry that we possess.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘The Song of Roland,’” says Mr. Ludlow, “apart from
any question of literary merit, has a peculiar interest for our
country, not only as forming one of the treasures of the Bodleian,
but from its connexion with one of the half dozen
greatest events in our history&mdash;the Battle of Hastings. For
there, as we are told by Wace, William of Normandy’s minstrel
‘Taillefer who full well sang, on a horse that was swift, went
before them singing <i>Of Charlemagne and of Roland, and of
Oliver and of the vassals who died at Roncevaux</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Ludlow, <i>Popular Epics of the Middle Ages</i>. London, 1865.</p></div>

<p>The very earliest text extant of this poem is in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford. All other songs of Roland are amplifications
of later date.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that to the chanting of this ballad by a
minstrel William went forward to the conquest of England.</p>

<p>One of the most popular books of the Middle Ages was the
<i>History of the Life of Charlemagne and of his Nephew Roland</i>,
which passed as the composition of Turpin, Archbishop of
Rheims, a man who died about 800. It was a historical
romance based on old ballads, composed in the twelfth century,
and of no historic value whatsoever. Pope Callixtus II
formally decided, however, in 1122, that it was veracious
history.</p>

<p>In this book we have the fully-developed story of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
defeat at Roncevaux. In it, declared by an infallible Pope to
be authentic and trustworthy, we are informed that Charlemagne
was eight feet high, measured by his own feet, “which
were of the largest size,” that at a meal he would consume
a quarter of a sheep, and if that were not at hand, then he
would appease his appetite with two fowls, or a duck, a
peacock, a crane, or a hare.</p>

<p>The army had marched into Spain, and Roland and Ganilon
the Traitor had been sent forward to Saragossa on an embassage
to the Soudan, who, according to the counsel of
Ganilon, spake fair and consented to all Charlemagne’s
demands. Consequently the host of the Franks returned
through the Pyrenees, unsuspicious of evil. Charles led the
van, and Roland and Oliver the rearguard. Meanwhile the
Saracens had gone about by bypaths, and they suddenly
appeared to intercept the march of that body of men which
was under the command of Roland and Oliver. A furious
fight ensued, Oliver fell, and Roland alone survived. Then
he put his ivory horn to his lips and blew such a blast that
Charles heard it, though many leagues away, and he knew
thereby that his nephew was in danger. With the blast
Roland broke a blood-vessel, and, sinking to the ground, he
dashed his good sword Durandal against the rocks with
intent to break it, lest it should fall into the hands of the
paynim.</p>

<p>To this day at Roncevaux a mass is said in May above
the tombs of the paladins, in the little chapel supposed to
have been founded by Charlemagne, and this mass is for
the repose of the souls of those who fell in the massacre of
Roncevaux.</p>

<p>Roncevaux itself consists of a few poor huts about a monumental
convent, from the midst of which rises the church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
with a massive square tower. The “royal and illustrious
collegiate church” was considered in Spain to be the fourth
in order of the holy spots on earth. The other three were
Jerusalem, Rome, and Compostella. The chapter was under
the special protection of the Holy See, and the King of Spain
nominated the prior. This dignitary and six canons are all
that remain of the ancient order of Roncevaux. Throughout
the convent may be seen its badge, a cross, the middle
member curved at the head like a pastoral staff, and with a
sword at the feet.</p>

<p>Pilgrims from France, Germany, and Italy were wont to
cross the Pyrenees on their way to Compostella, and many
lost their lives in the snow. On this account, in 1131, the
Bishop of Pampeluna founded a hospital at Roncevaux for
their accommodation, and he dispatched one of the canons
of his cathedral to attend to the requirements and comforts
of the pilgrims. This was the origin of the convent that grew
rich with the gifts of kings and princes who were lodged
there. The canons of Roncevaux wear a sleeveless surplice
and a black amice over their shoulders in summer, but
in winter a thick black cloak and a furred hood. When
they go out they wear a short linen scapular over their
cassocks.</p>

<p>Under the tower is a Gothic hall. This, with the cloister
and the church, was erected by Sanchez the Strong, King
of Navarre, in the thirteenth century. He and his wife
repose in the church under a marble tomb.</p>

<p>In this church is a Mater Dolorosa, the eyes of which are
apparently full of tears. This appearance is due to the insertion
of diamonds, but the ignorant peasantry are fully
convinced that the eyes of the Madonna really brim with
tears for their sorrows, and out of profound compassion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Near the convent formerly stood a pillar commemorative
of the defeat of Charlemagne’s rearguard, but the monument
was destroyed in 1794 by two commissioners of the French
Republic, to the performance of a “musique touchante.”
These men headed a column called l’Infernale; it entered
Spanish territory, and carried fire and sword everywhere.
They pillaged the church and the convent, and wrecked all
they could lay hands on.</p>

<p>Over this pass fled Joseph Bonaparte, without his crown,
after the rout of Vittoria. At Roncevaux is a little inn where
the traveller has an opportunity of seeing a Spanish kitchen,
with a central hearth, about which are ranged as many little
saucepans as there are visitors to be entertained, and of
hearing the custom-house officers play the guitar, and seeing
the muleteers dancing the fandango.</p>

<p>Smuggling thrives in the Pyrenees, indeed it is impossible
to suppress it. The most daring and successful of all smugglers
are the Basques, and the mountains in their part not
being of the loftiest, free trade can be carried on with comparative
ease. F. Michel, in <i>Le Pays Basque</i>, <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Contraband is a veritable profession that employs a great
many hands. Men thoroughly upright and strictly honest take
part in it. The chiefs are well known, and one is certain of
meeting with fidelity, integrity, and chivalrous devotion
among them. This may be understood, because their profession
depends mainly on the confidence which their character
inspires, and without which the merchants would not venture
to have recourse to them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Consider what the length of the chain is&mdash;350 miles as the
crow flies, 500 if you follow the frontier line. Tobacco is a
Government monopoly in France, and French tobacco is execrable.
There are in that 500 miles a thousand passes: some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
easy, others difficult. The douane cannot be everywhere; it
can be planted at certain fixed points, but the officers are not
ubiquitous, cannot guard every port, for the ports are in the
region of perpetual snow, where, if stationed, the officers
would freeze at their posts. Besides, the douanier gravitates
instinctively towards the cabaret, where he can have his wine,
his coffee, his absinthe, about a stove. And none of the
taverns are planted on the more difficult cols. Consequently
a very considerable traffic is done across the frontier by these
honourable and intelligent men, the smugglers.</p>

<p>In November, 1835, the Princess of Beira was on her way
from Naples to Spain to be married to the Pretender, Don
Carlos. She was his sister-in-law, but at Rome dispensations
are ever obtainable for money.</p>

<p>Ferdinand VII, by his third wife, Maria Christina, daughter
of Francis I, King of the Two Sicilies, had a daughter, Isabella,
born in 1830. Now Don Carlos was the brother of Ferdinand.
When this latter died, in 1834, Carlos claimed the crown.
Queen Christina had become regent, whilst Isabella was a
minor. Carlos went to the north of Spain, and war broke
out between the Carlists and the Christinos. Spain, Portugal,
England, and France united in quadruple alliance to support
the claims of Queen Christina. Carlos was in the Spanish
Biscay, and he summoned to him his son by his wife Maria
Frances, who was dead, and also his intended wife, the Princess
of Beira. This lady undertook to leave Naples, traverse
France, pick up on her way the Prince of the Asturias, who
was at Toulouse, and join her intended husband in the Basque
province of Spain.</p>

<p>Her journey had to be carried out with precaution, as
France opposed the pretensions of Don Carlos. She managed,
attended by the Count Custine and a Portuguese lady, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
secure the Prince of the Asturias and to make her way to
Bayonne. There she remained awhile in concealment till
warned that her retreat was discovered, when she fled and
delivered herself up to the protection and guidance of some
smugglers. After a day spent in wandering through the
forest of Mixe, with which her guides were unfamiliar, she
reached in the evening the valley of Mìharin, between Hasparren
and S. Palais. It had been arranged that she should
sup at the cabaret of Sallubria; but the place was so squalid
that Count Custine advised the Princess to throw herself on
the hospitality of the Viscount de Belsunce, who had a château
hard by. This she did, and was received with the utmost
civility, though it was not allowed to transpire who she was.
Thence one of the smuggler guides, Baptista Etchegoyen,
was dispatched with instructions to the contraband Captain
Ganis to aid the Princess in her escape. He arrived in the
middle of the night with some of his band, and with horses
carrying bundles containing disguises.</p>

<p>In order to reach the frontier it was necessary to pass
through Hélitte, a station of douaniers, on the high road from
Bayonne to S. Jean-Pied-de-Port. In order to effect this,
Ganis took advantage of a funeral that was to take place at
half-past ten in the morning. He left Méharin at 9 a.m.
attending the two ladies, dressed as mourners. At a little
distance from the place the Princess and her attendant had
to alight and go direct to the church, where Ganis informed
her they were to place themselves behind a tall woman in
mourning, and to follow her when she left the church. The
ladies assisted at the office for the dead, with hoods concealing
their faces. They followed the corpse to the cemetery, and
passed the station of the douaniers without attracting attention.
On reaching a valley they found horses awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
them, and by evening they had reached Macaye, near Hasparren,
where they lodged in the house of Ganis.</p>

<p>Fatigued by the journey, the Princess hoped to pass a
quiet night, but soon after dark an alarm was given. Fifteen
to eighteen hundred men&mdash;soldiers, gendarmes, and douaniers&mdash;were
patrolling the country in quest of the Princess.
A party of these men, suspecting that she was under the
protection of Ganis, approached the house with the purpose
of searching it. The smuggler roused the ladies, made them
follow him on foot, and under his conduct they reached the
banks of a river that was swelled by the rain then descending
in torrents. Ganis took the Princess on his back, and stepped
into the water. He was followed by his brother with the
lady-in-waiting. The flood rose to his armpits, and he had
the utmost difficulty in struggling across. Before he had
reached the further bank he heard shouts, and looking back,
saw a crowd of uniforms on that he had quitted. The smugglers
and their charges now made for the road into Spain by
Anhoue, and succeeded in passing the frontier without further
adventures.</p>

<p>Next morning the south wind bore to Bayonne the joyous
clatter of the bells of Urdase, and of all the Spanish villages
over the frontier, celebrating the marriage of the Princess of
Beira with the Pretender, Don Carlos of Bourbon. In the
meantime the Count Custine had remained with the Prince
of the Asturias in the château of M. de Belsunce. Baptista
now returned for them. They were disguised as Basque
peasants, mounted horses, and departed under the conduct
of the energetic and indefatigable Etchegoyen, who conducted
them by a different route from that taken by the Princess,
to where they met her and the Prince, his father.</p>

<p>It would be unpardonable to quit the Basques without a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
few words on the Couvade, a custom once prevalent among
them, but by no means peculiar to them, as it has been found
in Asia, Africa, and America.</p>

<p>Immediately after childbirth the woman rises and goes
about the business of the house, whereas the husband at
once retires to bed with the baby, receives the congratulations
of the neighbours, and is fed on broth and pap during
ten days. Strabo mentions this usage above eighteen hundred
years ago as prevalent among the Iberians, the ancestors
of the Basques. “The women,” he says, “after the birth
of a child, nurse their husbands, putting them to bed instead
of going to it themselves.” That this custom was widely
spread in the south of France appears from the medieval tale
of <i>Aucussin and Nicolette</i>. In it the hero finds King Theodore
<i>au lit en couche</i>, whereupon he takes a stick and thrashes
him till he vows to abolish the Couvade in his realms. Diodorus
Siculus, at the beginning of the Christian era, tells us
that this custom also prevailed in Corsica.</p>

<p>Marco Polo, in the thirteenth century, met with it in
Eastern Asia, so that the widow’s remark to Sir Hudibras
was not <span class="locked">amiss&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Chineses go to bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lie-in in their ladies’ stead.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The same custom is found among the American Indians.</p>

<p>What can be its meaning? What topsy-turvydom of
the human brain can have originated it? Mr. Tylor, in his
<i>Early History of Mankind</i>, says that it proceeded from a
notion that the woman was a mere machine for the turning
out of babies, and that the babes were not in the least supposed
to belong to her, but to the father. Also that the child
was part and parcel of the father, a feeble and frail parcel,
and that the utmost precaution had to be taken to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
male parent in health lest the child should suffer. If the
father were to take a pinch of snuff, the infant would sneeze
its brains away; if he were to eat solid food, the babe would
suffer indigestion. A missionary found it impossible to persuade
his Indian servant to eat anything but slops directly
after the birth of a son and heir, as he was persuaded heavy
diet would injure the child. Then the missionary belaboured
his servant with a stick, and sent him to look at his infant
smiling in its sleep, and so convinced the man of his delusion.</p>

<p>This may be the explanation. I cannot say. Mankind
does many things out of sheer cussedness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Orthez</span> has little to occupy it save to brood over its
past. It is a dull town, without characteristic features,
and it sulks because Pau the parvenue is flourishing, and
flaunting, whilst itself, the venerable Orthez, the once capital,
sits as a widow, desolate.</p>

<p>Till the fifteenth century it was the residence of the Court
of the counts of Foix and viscounts of Béarn, whose castle
of Moncada occupied the height above the town. A splendid
pile it was, erected by Gaston VII, in 1240, after the pattern
of a Spanish castle of the name that he had taken. This
had proved to him a hard nut to crack, and he hoped to make
the new Moncada by additional works wholly uncrackable.
But the tooth of Time has broken it completely, and nothing
of it now remains save the keep.</p>

<div id="if_p66" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p066.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE BRIDGE, ORTHEZ</div></div>

<p>The town was astir and aglow when Gaston Phœbus resided
in the castle. Froissart so describes it. Minstrels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
merchants, knights, adventurers, swarmed in the streets,
and streamed into the castle, which they did not leave empty-handed.
“I have heard him say, when the King of Cyprus
was in Béarn proposing a crusade, that if the kings of
France and of England had gone to the Holy Land, he
himself would have been the most considerable lord in the
host, second only to them, and would have led the largest
contingent.”</p>

<p>Gaston Phœbus, Count of Foix and Viscount of Béarn,
was the son of Gaston IX and the elderly Eleanor de
Cominges. On account of his beauty he was given the name
of Phœbus, and he adopted the blazing sun as his device.
He was arrested by King John of France when at Paris
because he refused to do homage for his lands, but was released
and given command of an army in Guyenne to war
against the English.</p>

<p>Froissart visited Orthez, and lodged at the tavern “La
Lune,” now rebuilt and renamed “La belle Hôtesse.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I must say,” wrote he, “that although I have seen many
knights, kings, princes, and other great men, I have never seen
any so handsome as he, either in mould of limb and shape, or
in countenance, which was fair and ruddy, lit up with grey,
amorous eyes, that delighted whenever he chose to express
affection. He was so perfectly formed that it is not possible
to overpraise him. Gaston Phœbus was a prudent knight,
full of enterprise and wisdom. He never allowed men of
abandoned character to be about his person; he reigned
prudently, and was constant at his devotions. He mightily
loved dogs above other animals, and during the summer and
winter amused himself with hunting. He employed four
secretaries, whom he called neither John, Walter, nor William,
but his Good-for-noughts, and to these he gave his letters to
copy out.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
But this prince was no other than a lusty, handsome
animal, incapable of controlling his passions, and whilst
profuse in largesses to wandering <i>jongleurs</i> and travellers,
who would bruit abroad his praises, mean in money matters
in other particulars.</p>

<p>Gaston Phœbus succeeded his father in 1343, and in 1348
married Agnes, daughter of Philip III of Navarre. By her
he had one son, Gaston, as beautiful as Phœbus himself,
and an amiable youth. Before long the Count and his wife
fell out. The quarrel was sordid&mdash;it concerned money.
Phœbus had imprisoned the Sieur d’Albret. The King of
Navarre, Charles the Bad, brother of the Countess, interceded
for his liberation, and undertook to guarantee payment
of fifty thousand francs for his ransom. Accordingly Gaston
released him, and d’Albret paid the money into the hands
of the King of Navarre, who pocketed it, and declined to send
it to the Count of Foix, under the plea that he was trustee
for his sister and reserved it as her dower. The Count resented
this upon his wife, whom he called by all the bad names
in his copious vocabulary. He had taken a mistress, and he
openly favoured her in the face of his wife for her humiliation.
By this woman he had three sons. Then he ordered Agnes
to visit the Court of Navarre and use her personal influence
to obtain the money due. The Countess went, but failed to
induce her brother to disburse; and knowing how ungovernable
was the temper of her husband, how little he loved her,
she shrank from returning to Orthez.</p>

<p>The boy Gaston at the age of fifteen entreated leave to
visit his mother at Pampeluna. The lad was distressed at
the estrangement, and pined for his mother. Accordingly
his father gave him a splendid retinue of gallant youths, and
the Bishop of Lescar as his chaplain. Charles the Bad resolved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
on a diabolical act of treachery. When the boy was
leaving he drew him aside, assured him of his distress at seeing
the lad’s father alienated in heart from his mother, and gave
him a bag of arsenic, which he informed him was a love powder.
This he was to strew on his father’s meat, or drop into his
cup, when Phœbus’s love for his wife would infallibly revive.
But on no account, said Charles, was Gaston to breathe a
word of this to any one, and he must be cautious to seize
the right moment for the administration of the dose, when
unobserved. Gaston, fully believing what his uncle said,
hung the bag round his neck under his dress, and returned to
Orthez.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Gaston and his half-brother, the
bastard Evan, slept in the same room. They were nearly of
the same age and size, and dressed alike. Evan did not fail
to notice the silk bag and questioned Gaston about it, but
was put off with evasive answers.</p>

<p>Three days after Evan and Gaston quarrelled over a game
of tennis, and Gaston boxed his half-brother’s ears. Evan
ran to his father and told him that Gaston carried in his
bosom a mysterious pouch of which he would give no account.</p>

<p>At dinner Phœbus was served by his son, Gaston, and looking
hard at him observed the string about his neck. Laying
hold of him, he tore open his vest, and discovered the bag of
powder. He cut the string, and gave some of the white contents
on a piece of meat to a dog, that ate it and died. Then
in a paroxysm of rage, knife in hand, he leaped over the table,
swearing that he would kill Gaston, who had purposed to
poison him. He would have slain him on the spot had not
his servants interposed and disarmed him.</p>

<p>The Count then ordered the boy to be thrown into a
dungeon. At the same time he had all the attendants of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
youth who had been with him in Navarre arrested and tortured,
and fifteen of them were forthwith hung. “Which
was a pity,” says Froissart, “for there were not in all Gascony
such handsome and well-appointed squires.” The Bishop
of Lescar had timely warning, and took to his heels.</p>

<p>The Count assembled the Estates of Béarn and laid before
them his charge against the boy, and they unanimously decided
that the prince must not be executed, but kept in
durance for awhile; nor would they separate till they had
extorted from Phœbus a solemn undertaking to submit to
their decision.</p>

<p>But the poor lad, knowing his innocence, wounded to the
quick at the manner in which he had been duped by his uncle,
at the blind conviction of his guilt entertained by his father,
at the barbarity with which his companions had been racked,
and strung up, refused all food. He was confined in a narrow
dungeon, badly lighted, and his gaoler at first did not observe
that the meals he brought him remained untouched. But
on the tenth day&mdash;I quote <span class="locked">Froissart&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The person who served him, looking about the cell, saw all
the meat unconsumed with which he had been previously supplied.
Then, shutting the door, he went to the Count of Foix
and said, ‘My lord, for God’s sake, look to your son, he is
starving himself in his prison. I do not believe that he has
eaten a morsel since his confinement.’ On hearing this the
Count was enraged, and without saying a word went to his son’s
prison. In an evil hour he had a knife in his hand, with which
he had been paring his nails. He held it so close by the blade
that of the point scarcely so much as the size of a groat showed.</p>

<p>“Thrusting aside the tapestry that covered the door of the
dungeon, through ill luck he struck his son on the jugular vein,
as he shouted, ‘Ha, traitor! why dost thou not eat?’ and
instantly flung out of the chamber without saying or doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
more. The lad was frightened at his father’s violence, and
was, moreover, weak through long fasting. The point of the
knife, small though it was, had severed the artery, and when
he felt what had been done, he turned himself on one side on
his pallet and expired.</p>

<p>“The Count had hardly returned to his apartment before
his servants came running after him to announce the death of
his son. ‘Dead is he? God help me!’ exclaimed the Count.
‘Dead he is, my lord.’ The Count was greatly affected, and
said, ‘Ah, ha, Gaston! what a sorry business this has proved
for me and thee.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was by no means his only crime. He induced his
cousin, Pierre Arnaut de Béarn, governor of the Castle of
Lourdes, to visit him, on the plea that he wished to discuss
matters with him. Arnaut held Lourdes for the English.
Gaston Phœbus desired to acquire this stronghold, which
was the key to the Valley of Argelez. He received Arnaut in
a friendly manner, and they dined together. For three days
he showed him lavish hospitality, and then demanded the
surrender of the castle. Arnaut refused. “I hold it for the
King of England. It has been confided to my honour,” he
replied, “and to no other person will I surrender my trust.”
Gaston Phœbus flew into one of his mad fits of rage, rushed
upon him, and stabbed him in five places with his dagger.
“My Lord,” said the gallant castellan, “this is ungentle
treatment, to summon me to your house as a guest, and therein
to murder me.” The Count ordered him to be flung into a
dungeon, where he died of his wounds.</p>

<p>The crime availed Phœbus nothing, for Jean, the brother of
Pierre, had been left in charge of the castle, and he refused
to give it up.</p>

<p>The Viscount of Châteaubon, the Count’s cousin-germain,
heir to his lands and titles, after the death of Gaston the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
younger, was greatly hated by Phœbus. He retained him
in prison for eight months, and only released him for a ransom
of fifty thousand francs. Froissart gives an account of the
end of Phœbus. He had been out hunting near Sauveterre,
in the month of August, when the heat was great. He had
killed a boar, that was brought to the inn at Riou, where the
Count would dine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Count went to his chamber, that was strewn with
rushes and green leaves; the walls were hung with boughs
freshly cut for perfume and coolness. He had no sooner entered
the room than he remarked, ‘These greens are agreeable
to me, for the day has been desperately hot.’ When seated
he conversed with Sir Espagne du Lyon (his chaplain) on the
dogs that had best hunted. He called for water to wash, and
two squires advanced. Ernaudin d’Espagne took the silver
basin, and another knight, Sir Thibaut, the napkin. The
Count rose from his seat, and stretched out his hands to wash;
but no sooner had his fingers touched the cold water than he
changed colour, from an oppression at his heart, and his legs
failing him, fell back on his seat, exclaiming, ‘I am a dead
man; but God have mercy on me!’ He never spoke after
this. He was carried to another chamber, and laid on a bed
and well covered.</p>

<p>“The two squires who had brought the water, to free themselves
from any charge of having poisoned him, said, ‘Here is
the water; we have already drunk of it, and will now do it
again in your presence,’ which they did, to the satisfaction of
all. They put into the Count’s mouth bread, water, and spices,
but all to no purpose, for in less than half an hour he was dead.”</p></blockquote>

<p>No sooner was the breath out of his body than Evan de
Foix, his bastard, whom he loved dearly, galloped to Orthez
to get possession of the treasure in the tower. On his admission
to the castle, before it was known in the town that
the Count was dead, he endeavoured to open the chamber<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
that contained the treasure, but failed; it was fast behind three
oak doors, and he could nowhere find the key. But in the
meanwhile the chaplain had found it upon the body of the
Count, and guessing the predicament in which was Evan, he
also took horse and raced off to Orthez.</p>

<p>By this time a vague rumour had reached the town that
something had happened to the Count, and the townsmen
began to assemble in the streets. The chaplain entered the
castle, and now that he was provided with the key Evan de
Foix was able to reach the treasure. But it was too late for
him to make off with it. Before he could pack it up and
form plans for its transport, the death of Gaston Phœbus was
known, and crowds surrounded the castle and forbade egress.
Evan was constrained to show himself at a window and speak
the citizens fair. They wished him no ill, they replied, but
they would neither suffer him to plunder and carry off the
treasure, nor leave the castle, till the Viscount of Châteaubon,
the lawful heir, had arrived&mdash;this latter was in Aragon at
the time. He at once started for Orthez, and a great assembly
of the Estates of Béarn was held. It was then determined
that of the treasure, the Viscount should have five thousand
francs, and the bastards, who had been put in chains till
the will of the Estates was known, should be set at liberty and
allowed each two thousand francs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Viscount of Châteaubon, on his arrival at Orthez, set
at liberty all prisoners confined in the castle. They were very
numerous; for the Count of Foix was very cruel to any person
who incurred his indignation, never sparing them, however
high their rank, but ordering them to be flung headlong over
the walls, or confined on bread and water during his pleasure;
and such as ventured to speak for their deliverance ran the
risk of being treated in like manner.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Gaston Phœbus was born in 1331, and died in 1391. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
left three bastards; of these Bernard married Isabella de la
Cerda, and became the ancestor of the dukes of Medina-Celi.
The eldest son, Evan, he who had unwittingly brought about
the death of his half-brother Gaston, met with a tragic fate.
A marriage was to take place between a squire in whom the
King, Charles VI, was interested and a damsel of the Queen’s
household, and it was arranged that there should be a masque
of savages in the evening, 29 January, 1392&ndash;3, in which the
King was to take part. There were to be six of these savages
in chains, and they were to perform a dance before the wedding
party, and one of these maskers was to be the Bastard of
Foix. The performers were to be dressed in coats of linen
covered with flax, stuck on by means of pitch, and these
linen vests were to be stitched on so as to fit the person tight
as a glove. Sir Evan de Foix, with some foresight, entreated
the King to forbid any one approaching the dancers with
torches. Such an order was accordingly issued, and when
the maskers entered the room, the serjeants commanded
all torch-bearers to withdraw. But, unhappily, whilst the
savages were capering, and producing much merriment, the
Duke of Orleans entered attended by four knights and
six torches, they being not aware of the King’s order, and
so amused were those present with the dance that this infraction
of the royal command was not noticed. No one
knew who the maskers were, and various conjectures were
offered. Happily for him the King quitted the others, by
unhooking his chain, and danced up to the Duchess of Berri,
who laid hold of him exclaiming, “You shall not escape me
till I have learned your name.”</p>

<p>At that very moment the Duke of Orleans, young and
thoughtless, ran forward with a torch to examine the savages
more closely. In an instant the flax on one ignited, in another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
moment the flame was communicated to the others, for those
five were chained together; only the King was unlinked. The
shrieks of those enveloped in flames were awful. Some
knights rushed forward and did their utmost to disengage
the dancers, but the pitch burnt their hands so severely, and
so impossible did they find it to rip away the habits, that they
were constrained to desist. One of the five, Jean de Nantouillet,
recollected that the buttery was near at hand. Exerting
all his force, he snapped the chain, and flying thither,
plunged into a large tub of water prepared for the washing of
plates and dishes. This saved him, but he ever after bore the
scars of his burns.</p>

<p>The Duchess de Berri, the moment that she saw what had
occurred, with presence of mind, threw her mantle over the
King, and retained him in her arms, as he was rushing off in
thoughtless generosity to endeavour to save his companions.
“Quick,” said she, “leave the room and assume another
dress.”</p>

<p>Evan de Foix, when enveloped in flames, cried aloud,
“Save the King! save the King!”</p>

<p>Of the four that were on fire, two died on the spot. The
other two&mdash;the Bastard of Foix and the Count de Joigny&mdash;died
two days after in great agony.</p>

<p>Orthez contains the Calvinist University established here
by Jeanne d’Albret, a building of the sixteenth century, now
no longer used for the purpose designed.</p>

<p>The bridge over the Gave is picturesque; it has one broad
arch spanning the river, and three pointed arches sustaining
the road leading to it, raised high to avoid floods. On the
main pier is a tower, whence in 1569 the Calvinist soldiery
of Montgomery precipitated the priests who would not
abjure the faith, upon the pointed rocks below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Jeanne d’Albret, after the death of her husband, Antoine
de Bourbon, threw off the mask, and set diligently to work
Protestantizing her dominions. She put one of her pastors
in the see of Oloron; her kinsman, d’Albret, Bishop of Lescar,
apostatized and married. She found in many places that the
people were ready for a change, especially such as had been
subject to exactions from the monasteries, which owned much
land and exercised extensive jurisdiction. In many, however,
there was strong resistance. In 1566 she was about to absolutely
interdict the exercise of the Catholic religion in Béarn,
Foix, and Bigorre, when the resistance of the Estates and the
threatening attitude of the people alarmed her and she
withheld the edict for a time. In 1568, finding that Charles IX
was about to send troops into her land to protect the oppressed
Catholics, and fearing lest she should have her children
taken from her, she fled to La Rochelle, the Geneva of French
Calvinism.</p>

<p>Charles IX announced his resolution to take possession
of Béarn. Bigorre was in revolt against her reforms, and a
good many of the seigneurs of Béarn could not endure them.
The King commissioned the terrible Monluc to pacify Bigorre,
and the Baron de Terride to do the same in Béarn. The
Béarnais were in difficulties. They were to a man loyal to
their Viscountess, the titular Queen of Navarre, but a considerable
number of them were opposed to her religious
policy, and did not relish the taste of Calvinism. If they
joined the forces of the King they were rebels to their
sovereign. If they took up arms for her they fought
for a religion that their soul abhorred. Nay, Pontacq,
Morlaas, shut their gates against the royal forces, and
were reduced. Lescar, Sauveterre, and Salies opened their
gates to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Béarn was rapidly reduced. Clearly the object at which
the King aimed was to bring it completely under the crown
of France. Two syndics of Béarn addressed the King in
the name of the Estates to declare that for eight centuries
the viscounty had been independent, that the King of France
was the protector but not the sovereign of the land. The
Queen of Navarre now gave commission to the Count of
Montgomery to drive the French out of her territories, and
to establish throughout them the reform of Calvin as the sole
religion permissible. Montgomery was the lieutenant of
the Scottish Guard, who, in a tournament, in 1559, had inadvertently
killed Henry II, King of France. Obliged to fly
the land, he placed his sword at the disposal of any prince
who was disposed to smite the Catholics and the Royalists
hip and thigh. Obeying the orders of Jeanne, communicated
to him from La Rochelle, Montgomery raised a body of
sturdy Huguenots and entered Béarn.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the rapidity of his movements, and himself at
the head of but a small body of men, the Baron de Terride
retreated to Orthez, and shut himself up in the Castle of
Moncada.</p>

<p>Montgomery arrived at Pontacq on 6 August, 1562,
crossed the Gave, and advanced on Orthez. There, taking
advantage of the gates being opened to receive fugitives
from the villages round, some of his soldiers thrust in. Simultaneously
the walls were escaladed, and the town was given
up to indiscriminate slaughter. In the name of their queen,
all the inhabitants were put to the sword.</p>

<p>The Gave rolled down the dead and flowed crimson with
blood. The Protestant historian Olhagaray says: “The
river was full of blood, the streets were heaped up with corpses.
The convents were burnt. The cries of the dying and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
shouts of the murderers, the lamentations of women and
children filled the air with piteous sounds.” The Convent
of the Cordeliers offered a theatre for barbarities. The
friars were made to leap from the windows into the river, and
were shot if they endeavoured to gain the bank.</p>

<p>No excuse offered for this massacre will avail. The town was
not taken after a siege; it was not stormed by night; it
was entered without offering resistance, in broad day. The
butchery at Orthez leaves an indelible stain on the brow of
Jeanne d’Albret.</p>

<p>A striking incident is remembered. One of the friars
was at the altar when the Huguenots burst in. He hastily
took the monstrance, folded his arms over it, and to save
the Host from profanation, threw himself into the Gave.
The river swept his body into the Bidouze, and the Bidouze
into the Adour, and it was washed up under the walls of the
Cordelier Convent at Bayonne, still clasping in its rigid arms
the vessel with its sacred contents.</p>

<p>Terride, accompanied by the principal chiefs, had retreated
into the castle, but with such precipitation that they had
forgotten to take in a supply of provisions. Consequently
in a few days they were forced to surrender, under oath from
Montgomery that their lives would be spared.</p>

<p>They were sent to Pau, ten barons of Béarn in all. One
evening they were invited by the Calvinist captain to dine
with him at his table in the Queen’s banqueting hall. During
the meal they shook off their despondency, and began to be
merry over their cups, when, at a signal from Montgomery,
soldiers entered and butchered all the barons about the table
where they had been feasting.</p>

<p>“This cruel execution,” says Favyn, in his <i>History of
Navarre</i>, “took place on 24 August, the feast of S. Bartholomew....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
The news angered King Charles greatly, and it is supposed
that he then formed the resolution of making a second
S. Bartholomew’s Day in expiation of the first.” So one crime
draws on another&mdash;a Nemesis, which, however, does not fall
on the criminals, but on the guiltless. Montgomery was
now master of Béarn. How many priests and monks were
slaughtered none knew. Nearly all the friars of Morlaas
were shot down. The prior of the Carmelites at Sauveterre
was hung, and the rest of the brethren thrown into a well till
they choked it up. All the priests caught near S. Sever were
led to the brow of a precipice and forced at the point of pikes
to leap down. At Orthez the prior of the Augustines was
ordered to mount the pulpit and recant. He ascended, but
it was to profess his adherence to the Catholic faith, whereupon
he was shot in the pulpit. All his seven brethren met
their fate with like heroism. They were made to walk down
a lane formed of Huguenot soldiers with swords drawn, and
were hacked to pieces, one after another.</p>

<p>The Calvinist soldiers did not even respect the dead. They
broke open the vault in which lay Gaston Phœbus, took his
skull, and played skittles with it. Great numbers of gentlemen
and their families, Catholics of every rank and sex, fled
to the mountains or crossed into Spain.</p>

<p>Montgomery, having finished with Béarn, left the command
with the Baron d’Arros, and departed for more active
work elsewhere. Jeanne d’Albret now dispatched injunction
after injunction, proclamation after proclamation, in one
continuous stream, into Béarn from her refuge in La Rochelle.
On 28 November, 1569, she required that Calvinistic worship
should be established everywhere, in every town and parish,
throughout her dominions; and in 1571 she forbade the celebration
of the Mass under pain of death. She would allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
an amnesty to such as had taken up arms during the late
troubles, but only on condition that they adopted her form
of religion.</p>

<p>In 1572 Jeanne died in Paris, not without suspicions of
poison. She had gone there to negotiate the marriage of her
son Henry with Marguerite de Valois, sister of Charles IX.</p>

<p>An excursion may be made to the Castle of Belocq, whose
towers are visible from the high road to Bayonne, on the
further side of the Gave. It is situated on a height, at the
feet of which the green river sweeps past the wooded slopes
on the farther bank.</p>

<p>The castle is ruinous. It consists of a large, irregular
yard with seven towers in the wall. The entrance gateway
is under a donjon. Through a little door one can mount to
the top by a flight of stone steps, disturbing the bats. On
the same side of the enclosure is a circular tower, octagonal
within, with a vaulted chamber in the basement. On the
west side is a beautiful little chamber in a tower, also vaulted.
One tower towards the river, and commanding it, has been
blown up and a great solid mass has fallen into the river
below; on it sit the washerwomen of the village beating their
linen. On the right bank, opposite Belocq, is the village of
Puyôo. Puyôo in patois signifies a tumulus, and the place
takes its name from a huge mound hollowed out as a cup at
the top. Certainly the substructure of a Frank wooden castle,
exactly like the tumps that are found in Southern Wales, and
the representations of fortresses in the Bayeux tapestry. The
hamlet of Puyôo is occupied mainly by Calvinists.</p>

<p>But that which will mainly interest an Englishman at
Orthez will be to go over the ground of the battle fought on
27 February, 1814, in which Lord Wellington defeated Marshal
Soult. It was, in fact, one of his most brilliant victories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Leaving Sir John Hope and Admiral Penrose to invest
Bayonne, Wellington, with the main force, had pushed on
in pursuit of the French under Soult. These were drawn up
at Sauveterre, but whilst Wellington demonstrated upon the
front of the line on which Soult rested, and whilst the attention
of the marshal was wholly engaged by the movements
in his front, Sir Rowland Hill crossed the Gave d’Oloron at
Villenave without opposition on 24 February and turned
his left. Upon this Soult hastily abandoned his ground,
transferred his headquarters to Orthez, and took up a formidable
position behind the Gave de Pau.</p>

<p>The position chosen by him was well selected and apparently
impregnable. A half-moon of heights of sandstone
and rubble, steep towards the west, and with gullies torn in
the sides, was occupied by him. His right rested on the bluff
above the village of S. Boës. The left flank rested on the
town of Orthez. A reserve of two divisions of infantry and
a brigade of cavalry were drawn up on an elevated and commanding
height by the road to Sault de Navailles. The
French marshal disposed of eight divisions of infantry and
one of cavalry, but these had been wasted from their former
strength, and hardly mustered forty thousand sabres and
bayonets, with forty guns.</p>

<p>Wellington was able, unopposed, to cross the Gave in
three places, in three advancing columns.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 27th Beresford, with the left wing,
commenced the action by turning the enemy’s extreme right
at S. Boës, whilst at the same time Picton assaulted the centre.
Hill, with the second British and Le Cor’s Portuguese brigade,
was to endeavour to force the passage at Orthez and attack
the enemy’s left. There was an interval of a mile and a half
between Beresford’s and Picton’s columns, and here was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
conical hill occupied by a Roman camp on the summit, and
separated by a marsh from the semilunar range held by the
French. On this height in the midst of the camp Wellington
took his station with his staff, having the whole battle
spread out like a map before him. Beresford, having overlapped
the French right, commenced a vigorous attack in
front and flank on the village of S. Boës. At length the English
reached the top of the hill, and, pursuing the enemy,
began to move along the narrow ridge which stretched from
S. Boës to the centre of the French position. But they
failed to dislodge the enemy, who kept up a rolling fire upon
their pursuers, and the artillery raked both flanks, occasioning
dreadful carnage, so that the English were brought to a stand-still.
At the same time a Portuguese brigade, completely
unnerved, turned and fled in disorderly rout, throwing our
own men into confusion.</p>

<p>Happily a brigade was moved up to cover the retreat of
the Portuguese and allow our own men to recover and re-form.
“At last I have him!” exclaimed Soult exultantly.
Wellington, from his point of observation, saw that the
effort to dislodge the French and roll them back on their
centre had failed. He then executed one of those sudden
and masterly changes of attack which exhibit the ready
resource of a great general. He at once ordered up the third
and sixth divisions to assail the centre of the enemy’s position,
and turn and take the right wing in flank. Simultaneously
Picton was to mount the ridge where the French had their
right centre, and, breaking the line of formation, drive it
back on to the left. The gallant troops crossed the swamp,
with the water up to their knees, and mounting the hill through
the brushwood unperceived by the foe, amidst the smoke,
with a loud shout and a withering fire plunged into the opening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
at the very moment that the French on the right were
pressing their advantage against Beresford, and were driving
the fourth division before them.</p>

<p>At the same time Picton reached the summit of the ridge
in the middle, drove the French down the slope, and, planting
his guns, plunged through the enemy’s masses from one end
of his position to the other.</p>

<p>Soult saw that the day was lost, and ordered the army to
retreat, which it did in regular echelons of divisions, and
they held the several positions taken up till the allies closed
on their front and moved upon their flank, Hill having by
this time crossed above Orthez and cut off the retreat by the
road to Pau. Then the French broke their formation, and
ran for Sault de Navailles with such speed that the great
body of them passed over the bridge in a wild, terror-stricken
crowd. However, nearly two thousand prisoners were
taken in the pursuit, and several guns. The French loss in
killed, wounded, and taken, exceeded six thousand, and some
hundreds afterwards deserted, or rather disbanded, and went
to their homes. The loss of the allies amounted to 2300.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to know what excellent discipline was maintained
by Wellington in his march through the Gascon land
from Bayonne to Toulouse. This was due not solely to
humanity towards the peasantry, but also as a precaution to
obviate insurrectionary movements in his rear. He issued
a proclamation, authorizing the people of the country, under
the mayors of the villages, to arm themselves, and arrest all
stragglers and marauders from the army. Allison <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nor did his proclamation remain a dead letter, for on the
night of the 25th the inhabitants of a village on the high road
leading from Sauveterre, having shot one British soldier who
had been plundering, and wounded another, he caused the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
wounded man to be hung, and sent home an English colonel
who had permitted his men to destroy the municipal archives
of a small town on the line of march. ‘Maintain the strictest
discipline; without that we are lost,’ said he to General
Freyre. By this means tranquillity was preserved in his rear
during this critical movement; and the English general
reaped the fruits of the admirable discipline and forbearance
he had maintained in the enemy’s country, by being enabled
to bring up all his reserves, and hurl his undivided force upon
the hostile army.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> situation of Pau is singularly favoured, and one can
appreciate the judgment of Henry II of Navarre in
transferring thither the court residence from Orthez. Pau
occupies the back of a rubble ridge stretching east and west,
facing the south, and drinking in the sunlight and warmth.
It does not suffer from cold winds. The land rises behind it
to the north, and one may see the clouds fly overhead without
feeling the air stir at Pau. The calmness of the atmosphere
often persists for weeks together.</p>

<p>In this it has an advantage over some of the towns of the
French Riviera, where the mistral cuts like a knife that has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
been frozen in an ice-pail. The bitter winds that sweep down
on the Riviera are produced by the snows of the Maritime
Alps. But there are no snows at the back of Pau. When
there is no breeding ground for icy winds, no icy winds are
hatched.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, a good deal of rain is brought up
and discharged over Pau, coming from the Atlantic; and a
whole month may elapse without the promenaders on the
terrace being able to catch a glimpse of the Pic du Midi
d’Ossau. The Girondin climate is notoriously rainy, especially
in spring; but nothing can surpass the splendour of the days
in summer and autumn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellis, who wrote her <i>Summer and Winter in the Pyrenees</i>
in 1841, <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At the foot of the woody range of high ground forming the
promenade runs the broad, shallow river Gave, with a perpetual
low murmur that lulls the senses to repose. It is, in
fact, the only sound we hear, for there is so little wind in this
climate that not a leaf is seen to move, and we therefore distinguish
at a greater distance the toll of the matin and vesper
bell in the neighbouring villages, and the tinkling sounds
which tell when the flocks are led to and from the fields. There
appears at first a sort of mystery in this universal stillness.
It seems like a pause in the breath of Nature, a suspension of
the general throb of life, and we almost feel as if it must be
followed by that shout of joy which the language of poetry has
so often described as the grateful response of Nature for the
blessings of light and life. And never, surely, could this response
be offered more appropriately than from such a scene
as this rich and fertile land presents.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was due to this climatic condition that in the first half
of last century patients in the early stages of consumption
were dispatched to Pau. Now that the treatment of phthisis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
is revolutionized, it is no longer a resort for such as suffer
from pulmonary complaints, but serves as a refuge from the
stormy English winters for those who desire pleasant resting
places where there are races, fox-hunting, and good company.
The climate, however, does not agree with all constitutions.
It is enervating, a land of lotus-eaters&mdash;</p>

<p>Pau, the old Pau, is attached on the north to the dreary
<i>lande</i> of the Pont-long that has belonged from time immemorial
to the inhabitants of the Val d’Ossau, and which is
strewn with tumuli. But from this plateau it is in part cut
off by the stream Hédas, that has cleft for itself a valley
dividing the town into two parts. New Pau has spread and
is spreading to north and east, so that its extremities have to
be reached by electric trams. Happily, to the west it cannot
encroach on the rubble ridge occupied by the park. Between
this park and the castle which occupies the extreme west of
the town the ridge has been sawn through by the stream,
but the gap has been widened artificially, and is now
spanned by a bridge.</p>

<p>The Castle of Pau was built at various dates. The four
towers and the curtain uniting them, except the south and
east faces, are the oldest part, and were erected by Gaston
Phœbus in or about 1363. The donjon to the east is of brick,
and is furnished with slots. The work begun by Gaston
Phœbus was continued by his successor, but the magnificent
south façade, the state buildings, and the enrichment of the
court within, in the style of the Renaissance, are due to
Henry II of Navarre; and the sixth tower was set up by
Louis Philippe.</p>

<p>The whole castle, especially the interior, has gone through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
a complete restoration, for it had been plundered and gutted
by the Revolutionists. The tapestries that now cover the
walls were collected from various places. The furniture, to
a large extent modern, is a clumsy imitation of old work;
there are, however, some fine ancient cabinets. In this
castle was confined for a while Abd-el-Kader. In 1848 I
visited him there several times. He had with him a suite
and his wives, all insensible to the stateliness of the castle
and the glorious panorama from the windows. They lounged
about the rooms silent and smoking, sulky, without occupation
and without interests. Their habits were so dirty
that the tapestries and rich furniture had all to be removed.
Abd-el-Kader had maintained a long and gallant resistance
against the French, and when he surrendered to the Duc
d’Aumale and General Lamorcière, it was on the stipulation
that he should be allowed to retire in freedom to Egypt or
into Syria. The terms were accepted and broken. He was
removed a prisoner to Toulon, then to Pau, and in November,
1848, he was transferred to Amboise. Napoleon III released
him in 1852, and he finally settled in Damascus. In the
terrible massacre of the Christians at Damascus in the summer
of 1860, by Turks and Druses, Abd-el-Kader acted with
such energy to protect the Christians that the Emperor of
the French sent him the gold cross of the Legion of Honour.
Possibly enough he may have been moved to this intervention
on behalf of the Christians by recollecting the kindness
that was shown him in his captivity by both English
and French residents at Pau, sending him fruit and flowers
for the ladies of his harem.</p>

<p>With the exception of the castle there is nothing of architectural
interest in Pau. The churches are modern, and the
predominant feature of the place is hotels, monster hotels
that even dwarf the castle.</p>

<p>But the great glory of Pau is the view of the chain of the
Pyrenees from the terrace and the park. That from the
Schänzle above Berne of the giants of the Oberland is beautiful,
but not comparable with the prospect from Pau. All
the middle distance in the view from Berne is filled up with
rolling hills, and it is over them that one catches glimpses of
the snowy heads of the Alps. But from Pau one has in
front the broad trough of the Gave, beyond which are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
coteaux, not too high, and not obscuring the lower parts of
the mountains. It is true that an obnoxious swell to the
south-west cuts off the prospect of the range to the Bay of
Biscay, but the mountain range can be traced eastward till
it fades into vapour, and the mountains on that side are by
far the boldest and loftiest. Moreover, one can look from
Pau right up the gap of the Val d’Ossau to the roots of the
Pic du Midi, an exquisitely beautiful mountain, only surpassed
by the Matterhorn; and it has this advantage over
its rival, that it can be seen from a great distance, which
the other cannot.</p>

<p>Below the terrace of the castle rises the insignificant tower
of la Monaye, where the specie for circulation in Béarn and
the annexed counties was coined.</p>

<p>In the second chapter I told the story of the House of
Foix and Béarn down to the death of Catherine, who ate out
her heart with rage because she could not acquire the kingdom
of Upper Navarre, to which she laid claim. Her son and
successor was Henry II of Navarre.</p>

<p>He obtained the name of Henry in a somewhat singular
fashion. At his birth a pilgrim was passing through Pau,
of obscure origin, named Henry, on his way to S. James
of Compostella. Jean d’Albret, moved by a sudden freak,
summoned this man to be godfather to his boy, the heir to
the crown of Navarre, instead of inviting a prince to stand
sponsor. This occasioned much ridicule among the haughty
Spaniards, who said it presaged that the young Henry would
be a stranger to his kingdom.</p>

<p>He was brought up with Francis I of France, and the two
were warmly attached to each other. He accompanied
Francis in his disastrous expedition to the Milanese, and
shared captivity with the King at Pavia. His ransom was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
fixed at a hundred thousand crowns. Henry did not care to
burden his little territory with such a charge, and he devised
means to escape. A lady in Pavia managed to convey to
his prison a rope ladder, and one night in December, 1525,
when the moon shone, he slipped out of the window of his
cell and descended the ladder. It was too short, and he fell
into the moat. Happily this was more full of mud than of
water, and without loss of time he scrambled out, plastered
with slime, mounted a horse, held in readiness by his accomplices,
galloped away, and managed to reach Lyons. On
the morning after his evasion the commandant of the Castle
of Pavia entered the cell and bade his royal prisoner get up.
A voice from the bed replied, “For pity’s sake, let me sleep
a little longer.” He who spoke was a page of the King of
Navarre, who had taken his place, so as to deceive the guards
and give his master time to escape.</p>

<p>The affection and esteem which Francis I had for Henry
were shown in that he gave him as wife his dearly-loved sister
Margaret, the “Marguerite des Marguerites, sa mignonne,”
as Francis called her. The marriage took place on 24 January,
1527. The Court of Paris was inconsolable at the loss of
the lively and charming princess. The Parisian doctors
remonstrated with her at going to so inclement a place as
Pau where, said they, “le gros air du pays lui serait
mortel.” However, go she would, with her beloved
Henry, and on reaching Pau she at once set to work to
make herself happy, and to be beloved by the people.
She began by studying the patois and worked at it so
diligently that she was herself astounded at the progress
she made.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The newly-married pair,” says an old historian, “deliberated
how to put Béarn in a better condition from that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in which they found it. This land, good and fertile by nature,
was in a poor state, uncultivated and sterile through the negligence
of the inhabitants. It soon changed its appearance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Henry devoted himself especially to agriculture; he invited
farmers and labourers from Brittany, Berry, and the
Saintonge to settle in the land and teach the natives improved
methods of cultivation; and the introduction of
maize into Béarn was due to him. He set up a linen factory
at Nay, and a printing press at Pau. He collected, revised,
and edited the <i>fors</i> of Béarn, and had them printed at his
press in 1551.</p>

<p>One of the most important pages in the life of the Queen
of Navarre in the Château of Pau was the part she played in
receiving refugee Huguenot preachers. But she never herself
became a convert to Calvinism; she entertained great pity
for the innovators who were driven from place to place, and
subjected to cruel persecution. She offered them an asylum,
and listened to their harangues without the impatience
shown by her husband, who, when they began to preach,
retired to his bottle and his cards.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Queen of Navarre,” says Florimond de Rémond,
“gave ear to them, received their books at first by the hand of
her ladies, has had the Latin prayers of the church translated
into French ... out of kindness of heart she throws open
her house to the proscribed and banished, and bids them regard
it as a retreat and refuge. She exercises marvellous care
in protecting those who are in danger on account of their
religion, and in succouring the refugees from Strassburg and
Geneva.</p>

<p>“Roussel was received by this good princess into Béarn and
given a state lodging in her house. She takes pleasure in
listening to him as he discourses on religion. He persuaded
her to read the Bible, then very uncouthly translated into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
French; and this so pleased her that she composed a tragi-comic
translation of nearly the whole of the New Testament,
and had it acted in the great hall before the King, her husband.
For the purpose she secured the best comedians that could be
procured from Italy; and as these buffoons are born only to
afford amusement, and, monkey-like, to mimic what may
meet the humours of their masters, so these people, recognizing
the inclination of the Queen, interlarded the text of these plays
with roundelays and virolais on the theme of the clergy.
Always some poor monk or <i>religieuse</i> was made the butt in one
of these comedies or farces.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Florimond de Rémond goes on to say that some of the
preachers harboured by Marguerite were not of high character.
Among them was Solon, a runaway Carmelite, a “brave et
courageux moine,” who embraced the doctrines of Calvin,
and to make up for wasted opportunities in the past married
and buried five wives in succession.</p>

<p>Some of the sacred pieces enacted before the King and Queen
were the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi, the Flight into
Egypt; and into these plays scurrilous and indecent songs
were introduced, without a word of protest from the preachers.</p>

<p>Marguerite took as her valet Clement Marot, who had not
the best of characters, and scandal said that she liked him a
little too well.</p>

<p>Unsuspectingly Marot did a great work for Calvinism in
France.</p>

<p>He had translated the Psalms of David into popular
rhythm. His metrical version became the rallying songs of
the Huguenots, and formed the basis of their liturgy. They
were set to popular folk-airs.</p>

<p>The French ladies, as he said himself, placed</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">leurs doigts sur les espinettes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">pour dire saintes chansonettes.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
So little heretical was his version regarded that in 1540,
before it was printed, Francis I made a present of it to
Charles V. Florimond de Rémond <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Each of the princes and courtiers adopted one or other of
the psalms for himself. King Henry chose as his own Psalm
<span class="smcap smaller">XLII.</span>, <i>Ainsi qu’on oyt le cerf bruire</i>, which he sang when hunting.
Mme. de Valentinois (Diana of Poitiers), his mistress, took as
hers Ps. <span class="smcap smaller">CXXX.</span>, <i>Du fond de ma pensée</i>, which she sang when
galloping. The Queen had selected <span class="smcap smaller">V.</span>; <i>Ne veuillez pas, O Sire</i>,
set to a buffoon melody. The King of Navarre, Antoine de
Bourbon, chose <span class="smcap smaller">XLIII.</span>, <i>Revenge moy, prens la querelle</i>, which he
sang to a branle (a dance tune) of Poitou; and so with the
rest.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But little by little these metrical psalms assumed an
aggressive tone; passed among the people, and these took
them to heart more seriously than did the courtiers.</p>

<p>Bordier, in his <i>Chansonnier huguenot</i>, <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was soon seen with what energy the Huguenots assimilated
this poetry, which responded so well to their burning
faith. They knew the psalter by heart. It became one of the
tokens by which they recognized one another at long distances,
before coming in sight, when certain familiar melodies were
borne to their ears. From the windows of the Louvre Henry II
more than once saw a crowd flushed with enthusiasm fill the
Pré aux Clercs, promenading in the evening with gravity,
trolling out these psalms.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Queen of Navarre was certainly a strange mixture;
she wrote treatises of piety, composed a <i>Mirror of the Sinful
Soul</i>, wrote songs, and in her old age was the authoress of
that book of indecent tales, the <i>Heptameron</i>, which is still
read, whereas the <i>Mirror of the Sinful Soul</i> is forgotten.</p>

<p>She took as her device the marigold turning to the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
and as her motto, “Non inferiora sequor,” hardly appropriate
to the compiler of the <i>Heptameron</i>.</p>

<p>A pretty story is told of her by Brantôme. She had as
one of her ladies-in-waiting Mlle. de la Roche, who had been
the mistress of Captain Bourdeille, but whom he had cast
aside and forgotten. Mlle. de la Roche died in the Queen’s
service at Pau, and was buried in the church of S. Martin.
Three months later Bourdeille came to Pau, and was received
by the Queen, who invited him to attend her to the church.
When there, standing in a certain place, Marguerite said to
him, “Do you feel the ground heave under your feet?”
“Not in the least,” he replied. “Surely you do?” “Madame,
I assure you that I do not.” “That is strange,” said
the Queen, “for beneath your feet lies your poor, deserted
Mademoiselle de la Roche, sighing because that above her
stands the man who deceived her. I leave you now alone
to your reflections.”</p>

<p>Marguerite entertained a horror of death, but on hearing
that her dearly-loved brother Francis was no more, her joy
of life, her spirits left her, her health failed, and she died at
Odos in Bigorre in 1549.</p>

<p>Her daughter, Jeanne d’Albret, was left heiress of Navarre,
Béarn, Bigorre, Foix, and Armagnac, which had been part of
her mother’s dower. Jeanne was born in the Castle of Pau in
1528. At an early age she was removed to the Court of the
King of France, and was betrothed at the age of twelve, and
married in 1546, when eighteen years old, to the Duke of
Cleves, who was twelve years her senior. She was so burdened
with pearls and embroidery over brocade and gold lace
at her wedding that she was unable to walk, and had to be
carried into the church from the carriage in the arms of the
Constable of France. But she did not relish the union, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
it was annulled. In 1548 Jeanne married Antoine de Bourbon,
a feeble, voluptuous, irresolute creature, “to one thing
constant never.” He was first a Catholic, then a Huguenot,
under the influence of the commanding intellect of his wife,
and then a Catholic again; it mattered not to him, for he had
no fixed principles. But Jeanne never forgave his rejoining
the Church, for she was a bigoted Calvinist.</p>

<p>Jeanne was nearly deprived of her husband. Antoine de
Bourbon, who was suspected of taking part with his brother,
the great Condé, in the conspiracy of Amboise, 1550, was
marked out for destruction. The two brothers were arrested
by Francis II. Olhagary, a Protestant writer, gives what
follows. He had it from the recital of Queen Jeanne herself;
but how far coloured by her prejudices we are unable to say.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Prince of Condé was sentenced to have his head cut
off before the King’s residence, on 10 December. Antoine de
Bourbon was to be stabbed by the King himself. For this he
was ordered to attend in the chamber of the King, who pretended
to be ill. Francis was to stab him with his own hand,
aided by the Guises who were hid behind the arras.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Antoine was on the point of entering the presence chamber
when the Duchess de Montpensier caught him by the arm
and revealed to him the plot. He then withdrew. But again
a messenger arrived from the King ordering him to appear.
Then he summoned to him Reuti, the captain of his guards,
and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am going to where my death is planned, but never shall
skin be sold so dearly as I will sell mine. I beseech you to
render me this last service. If I die, take my shirt soaked in
my blood, and carry it to my wife and son, and charge her&mdash;for
my son is too young to be able to avenge me&mdash;to send the
pierced and bloody shirt to all the foreign princes, and call on
them to avenge my death.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Antoine then entered the room where was the King, but
his behaviour, the frankness with which he met the charges
laid against him, caused the heart of Francis to relent,
and he dismissed the King of Navarre unhurt. It was
then that the Cardinal of Lorraine exclaimed, referring
to the weakness of the King&mdash;“There is the heart of a
poltroon!”</p>

<p>Jeanne had been the mother of two sons; the elder died of
over-coddling, the second of an accident. When she was
again expecting her confinement, her father, Henry II, roughly
told her that she did not know how to manage her children,
and insisted on her coming to the castle at Pau for confinement,
under his eye. She obeyed, and arrived on 4 December,
1553. Then the old King showed her a casket of gold,
attached to a chain long enough to go thrice round her neck.
“Do you see this?” said he; “I will give it you along with
my will, that is in this box, if you will sing a Béarnais song
whilst in your pangs, so that the child may not be a
squaller.” She promised, and on 14 December, feeling her
hour approach, sent for her father, and began to sing a
Béarnais hymn to Our Lady at Bridgend; for there was
a chapel to the Blessed Virgin on the ancient bridge over
the Gave. Her song <span class="locked">was:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Nousté Dame deii cap d’eii poun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adjudat me à d’aqueste ore,” etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But as many of my readers do not understand the patois,
I will give it in <span class="locked">English:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Our Lady at the head of the bridge, assist me in this hour.
Pray to God in Heaven, that He may deliver me, that the fruit
of my body may see the light.... Our Lady at the head of the
bridge, assist me in this hour.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
She gave birth&mdash;some say on 13 December, some on
14 December&mdash;still singing, to a boy. Henry II took it from
her, gave her the casket, saying, “This is for you,” and as
to the boy, “this is for me.” Then he rubbed the child’s
lips with garlic, and poured into its mouth some drops of
Jurançon wine, and said: “Va, tu serras un vrai Béarnais.”</p>

<p>When Marguerite had given birth to Jeanne the Spaniards
had remarked, “The cow has littered a lamb!” in reference
to the cow in the Béarnais arms. Now Henry d’Albret,
taking the child in his arms, showed it to his nobles and
exclaimed: “See, the lamb has littered a lion!”</p>

<p>In the castle is shown the cradle in which the future king
of France, Henri Quatre, was rocked. It is a large tortoise-shell,
inverted, and suspended by silken cords. When the
Sansculottes burst into and sacked the château in 1793, they
purposed to destroy this relic of royalty. But the commandant
of the castle had foreseen this, and had substituted for
the original another tortoise-shell, obtained from the cabinet
of a naturalist in the town. This latter was destroyed, but
the original was preserved in the attics of the castle.</p>

<p>At Bilhère, a little way out of Pau, on the road to Orthez,
is the cottage in which Henry was nursed by a peasantess.
That cottage remains much in the same condition as it was
then, and is pointed out to visitors with pride.</p>

<p>When only five years old his mother took him to Paris to
present him to Henry II, King of France. The King took
the little prince in his arms and asked him, “Veux-tu être
mon fils?” The child, unable to speak other than Béarnais
patois, pointed to his father and answered, “Aquet es lou
seignou pay” (This is monsieur, my father). “You are
right,” said the King, “but as you will not be my son, will
you be my son-in-law?” To which the boy promptly replied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
“Obé.” Marguerite de Valois was then eighteen months
older than Henri.</p>

<p>After a while in Paris he was taken back to Pau and committed
to the care of Suzanne de Bourbon Busset, Baroness
Miossens, who was sent with him to the Castle of Coarraze,
near Nay, with instructions that he should be reared among
the children of the mountains on simple, wholesome diet.</p>

<p>Accordingly he was treated like the peasant children&mdash;was
clothed in the same garb, and partook of the same athletic
sports. His food was often dry bread. Frequently he trod
the mountain paths with bare feet, or clattered about in
sabots. For many years he knew no other tongue than the
patois, and in after life a bon mot, or a lively sally in his
maternal language, served as one of the most powerful means
by which to influence the young Gascons whom he led to
battle.</p>

<p>Antoine de Bourbon fell at the siege of Rouen in 1562,
fighting against the Huguenots, and Jeanne was then left
free to force Calvinism on her subjects. Thenceforth she was
able to rule despotically in her own dominions, till interfered
with by the French king. Beza, with approval, records her
declaration: “Sooner than ever again attend Mass, or suffer
any of my subjects or my children to do so, I would, if possible,
cast them into the depths of the sea.” And to Henry, when
young, she said passionately that should he at any time
attend Catholic worship, she would repudiate and disinherit
him.</p>

<p>She began by confiscating Church property and appropriating
to herself monastic lands. Commissioners were
appointed to go through the country, wreck the churches,
and sweep into her mint all the gold and silver chalices,
candlesticks, and crucifixes, to be coined into money. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
expelled the priests and put ministers in their place. At Pau
she hung two of the canons of S. Martin’s, and sent a Huguenot
preacher into the pulpit. The town council remonstrated.
The Queen’s reply was that she would with her troopers
drive the councillors to be present at his predications. She
made it punishable with death as high treason not only for
a priest to say Mass, but for man, woman, or child to attend
at one.</p>

<p>Charles IX of France went to Nerac, in Gascony, to visit
Jeanne.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In some respects,” says Mr. White, “the province of Gascony
through which the Court was now travelling, had suffered
more than any part of France from the effects of the war.
The Protestants had succeeded in putting down Romanism,
and at every step he took Charles was reminded of the outrages
offered to his religion; he restored the old form of worship,
but the scenes he then witnessed appear never to have been
forgotten. As he rode along by the side of the Queen of
Navarre he pointed to the ruined monasteries, the broken
crosses, the polluted churches; he showed her the mutilated
images of the Virgin and the saints, the desecrated graveyards,
the relics scattered to the winds of heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Jeanne looked with sparkling eyes and with a heart that
swelled with exultation at this wreckage, but she noticed
the pain it caused to the young king, and thenceforth regarded
him with distrust.</p>

<div id="if_p100" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p100.jpg" width="600" height="452" alt="" /><div class="caption">ROOM OF JEANNE D’ALBRET, CASTLE OF PAU</div></div>

<p>A Béarnais named Gondin ventured to remonstrate with
Jeanne at her high-handed dealings. “The King of France,”
said she, “choses to have but one religion in his realm. I am
a queen, and I choose to have but one.” “The King of
France!” echoed Gondin; “that is another matter. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
could cross your majesty’s kingdom in a hop, skip, and jump.”
“Then I will trouble you, sir, to hop, skip, and jump out of
my realm, and that smartly,” was her prompt reply.</p>

<p>At the same time that Jeanne issued her order for the
change of religion, she forbade the dances of the peasantry
and wailing at funerals.</p>

<p>Of Jeanne d’Albret it might be said in the words of Quintus
Curtius: “Nihil præter vultum fœmineum gerens.” Marguerite
de France, sister of Francis II, Charles IX, and
Henry III was married in 1572 to Henry of Navarre. The
union was not happy, neither cared for the other; and
when Marguerite came to Pau she was affronted at her
treatment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We came to Pau,” she wrote, “where no exercise of the
Catholic religion is tolerated. However, I was allowed as a
favour to hear Mass in a little chapel three or four paces in
length, and so narrow that seven or eight persons filled it. At
the hour of Mass, the drawbridge was raised to prevent the
Catholics of the place from attending; for they were most
desirous to do so, having been debarred from it for several
years. But, it being Whit-Sunday, some of the citizens
succeeded in slipping in before the drawbridge was raised.
They were not detected till the end of the service, when some
Huguenots who were spying perceived them. They instantly
informed the king’s secretary, and in my presence were dragged
out, whipped, and cast into prison, and were not released for
long, and then not till they had paid a heavy fine.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When Henry IV came to the throne of France the care of
his hereditary dominions in Gascony was confided to his
sister Catherine. In the Castle of Pau at that time was
brought up Antoine de Bourbon, Count of Moret, Henry’s
son by Jacqueline de Bueil. There he studied, but proved
a sorry scholar. In later days he ventured on criticizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the works of Gombaud, whereupon this latter retaliated
with an epigram.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Vous chocquez la nature et l’art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vous qui n’êtes né que d’un crime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais pensez vous que d’un bastard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le jugement soit légitime?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Antoine fell in the battle of Castelnaudary, in 1631. Half
a century later, there appeared in Anjou an old hermit, who
called himself John Baptist, and whose face resembled Henri
Quatre markedly. Moreover, he admitted having been
in the battle of Castelnaudary, and showed himself to be
intimately acquainted with Pau and with every part of the
castle; but he would never say who he was. Louis XIV,
having heard of him, sent to demand whether he was the
Antoine de Bourbon, son of Henry IV, who had been reported
dead. He refused to answer, and on his death-bed, when
again questioned on this point, returned an evasive answer.</p>

<p>In matters of religion Henry IV was tolerant. He wrote
in 1594:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have in my kingdom of Béarn two parishes separated only
by a river. In one of these there has never during my reign
been any (Calvinist) preacher; in the other, never a Mass said,
yet the inhabitants of these parishes have not wronged one
another to the value of a sou. You will see, that I will bring
about such concord in my kingdom that there will be no further
squabbles.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But before this, when in Paris, under the surveillance of
Catherine de Medici, he was obliged to send the Count de
Grammont and a commission into Béarn to restore Catholic
worship. D’Aubigné relates an incident relative to this
attempt that is characteristic of the temper of the times.
When the Baron d’Arros, who had been appointed after
Montgomery, by Jeanne d’Albret, to enforce the sole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
exercise of Calvinistic worship in her states, heard of the
coming of De Grammont, he happened to encounter his
father, aged eighty, and blind, coming out of the Huguenot
meeting-house. The old man led his son home, placed in
his hands a drawn sword, and bade him slay and spare not
the Lord’s enemies. Arros and thirty-seven followers went
to Hagetmau, where Grammont and the commissioners were,
and entered the castle unperceived. Then they fell upon
and slaughtered officers, soldiers, and servants, indiscriminately.
De Grammont alone was spared. His wife&mdash;Corisande
d’Andouins, one of the loveliest women of the time&mdash;threw
herself between her husband and Arros, and with
tears implored the latter to spare Grammont.</p>

<p>When the Baron d’Arros returned to his father to receive
a blessing after this exploit, the old man bitterly reproached
him for having spared even one. “My son,” said he, “how,
as a valiant Maccabee, have you allowed this Nicanor to live?
The crow you have spared will pluck out your eyes.”</p>

<p>Calvinism, after having had complete mastery for over
half a century, seems not to have taken firm root. At the
present day, out of a population in Béarn of 426,350, there
are but 5000 Protestants.</p>

<p>In one of his bear-hunting expeditions, when a lad, Henry
of Navarre had visited the church of Bielle in the Val d’Ossau,
and had noticed the columns of Italian marble in the church,
the spoils of a Gallo-Roman villa. When he was king he
sent to Bielle to have these pillars forwarded to him in Paris.
The reply of the villagers was: “Sire, our hearts and our
properties are yours, dispose of them as you will; but as to
these columns, they belong to God. <i>Entendez vous-en avec
lui.</i>”</p>

<p>As king, Henry said that his ambition was that every one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
of his subjects, every peasant in Béarn, should be able every
Sunday in the year to put <i>la poule au pot</i>! A couple of
centuries later an epigram was written thereon.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Enfin, la poule au pot sera donc bientôt mise;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On doit du moins le présumer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Car, depuis deux cent ans qu’on nous l’avait promise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On n’a cessé de la plumer.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He did not forget the good things he had eaten in his native
land when far away in Paris, and he wrote to Pau to have
sent to him “some good melons, muscat grapes, figs, and
peaches”; and again, “a dozen geese of Béarn, the fattest
that can be found, such as will do honour to my country.”</p>

<p>The old cathedral church of Lescar occupies a very ancient
site&mdash;a Roman town, Beneharnum, on the great Roman road
that ran from Narbonne to Dax. The church deserves a
visit. Although not large it is fine, dating from the twelfth
century. It was erected apparently on the site of some
Roman building, for the mosaic that surrounds the high altar,
and marks where stood the original apse of the first church,
is Roman work, and represents a tiger hunt. It was formerly
covered by the floor of the stalls; but these have been
removed, and the mosaic, that was much injured, has been
restored carefully.</p>

<p>The whole of the low country, and the bottoms of the
mountain valleys, were occupied by Romans. Gallic nobles had
their villas that studded the land. At Bielle, already mentioned,
is a mosaic pavement, and an evidence of the luxury
of the period is seen in this villa having had pillars of marble
brought from Italy. Other mosaic pavements have been
found at Biellan, near Lescar, and at Taron-Sadirac, in the
garden of the <i>presbytère</i> and in an adjoining field. The high
altar of the church there is entirely formed of slabs taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
thence. In 1847, when I was a boy, I heard peasants romance
about a “Palais des Fées,” that lay underground in a field
by the Lyss, in the commune of Jurançon. I visited the
spot and found numerous cubes of mosaic of diverse colours
in a ditch. I then saw the peasant proprietor and asked him
whether he had discovered anything when ploughing. “Mais
oui!” he said; “five years ago I uncovered a picture that
represented men sitting about a table drinking and playing
cards.” I knew how to make allowance for a Gascon’s
imagination, so I bargained with the man to allow me to
institute a search. We cut a trench parallel to the stream
and crossed walls and mosaic pavements through a length
of 150 feet. I then came to terms with the owner of the
field. He was to allow me to dig, and he was to charge two
sous at the gate for admission.</p>

<p>In a fortnight we had cleared out several rooms, and then,
as my pocket-money was exhausted, the English of Pau
raised a subscription to pay for the prosecution of the work.
In the end we uncovered eleven chambers with well-preserved
mosaic floors, and two more of which the floors had broken
in upon the heating apparatus underneath, but which had
been very richly patterned. The villa consisted of a suite
of winter rooms and another for summer residence. In the
former all the floors and walls were warmed by a hypocaust.
The villa was, moreover, well furnished with baths.</p>

<p>In the middle, between the winter and the summer quarters,
was the atrium, a court with a tank, in the midst, of pure water,
conducted into it by a lead pipe from a well in the hill above.
The bottom of the tank was paved with mosaic, representing
marine animals, fish, crabs, etc., and the two containing walls
were cased in slabs of coloured marbles. Opening out of the
atrium was the <i>tablinum</i>, the reception room of the house;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the walls skirted with alabaster, above which they were
painted. The most remarkable of the representations on
the floors was in the hall next the entrance porch; it showed
a cross in mosaic, with a monstrous bust of Neptune at the
intersection of the arms, surrounded by fish and lobsters.</p>

<p>When the villa was almost wholly excavated, the municipality
of Pau purchased the field, and built a shed over the
foundations, but, penny wise and pound foolish, neglected
to cut a drain around the remains. The consequence was
that each room became full of water in the winter, and, frost
ensuing, split up the mosaics. When I revisited Pau two
years later most of the pavements were ruined. Now, shed
and every trace of the villa are gone; the whole is ploughed
over, and the only token that there was anything of interest
in the field is a notice-board set up to forbid trespassers
invading it. On the farther side of the stream is another
villa, which I began to dig out, but found the pavements
nearer the surface and not so well preserved. Moreover,
the proprietor got it into his head that I had discovered
and appropriated a pot of gold coins, and he peremptorily
forbade further research.</p>

<p>The bridge over the river, some quarter of a mile down, is
called le Pont d’Auly (<i>pons aulæ</i>), and on the height of
Guindalos above are the earthworks of a Roman camp.</p>

<p>Pau has produced several eminent men. Hardly had
Henri Quatre closed his eyes before the town gave birth to
Gassion, born in 1609. His father purposed making of him
a lawyer; but, as a lad of sixteen, rather than be chained to
a desk, he started barefoot from Pau, with his shoes slung
to a stick over his back, and with twenty sous in his pocket.
He entered the army, and his life was spent in warfare, beyond
the Alps, on the Elbe, on the shores of the Baltic. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
wounded seventeen times, and fell on the field of battle at
the age of thirty-six, a marshal of France and the greatest
captain of his age.</p>

<p>More fortunate than he was Bernadotte, also a soldier
risen from the ranks, who became King of Sweden and Norway.
He was born in the little house, No. 6 Rue de Trau, and was
the son of a needy scrivener. His name in full was John
Baptist Julius Bernadotte, and he was born on 26 January,
1764. He became a drummer-boy in the marines at the age
of seventeen.</p>

<p>He came to the front at an opportune time. The Revolution
had turned France topsy-turvy. The officers had fled
the country to escape the guillotine, and the corporals and
serjeants stepped into their places. The regiments elected
their captains, and the history of the Republican wars shows
that the soldiers exercised their electoral rights with discretion.
In 1792 Bernadotte was a colonel.</p>

<p>The Directory appointed him ambassador at Vienna.
The choice was not happy; he had not the breeding of a
gentleman, and behaved with insolence in the most punctilious
of courts. On the day upon which the volunteers
were enrolled for the defence of their country, Bernadotte
ostentatiously hoisted the tricolour, which the mob tore down.
The ambassador in vain demanded satisfaction. He quitted
Vienna, but the Directory disavowed him. Soon after his
return to France he married Eugènie, the daughter of the
soap-boiler, Clary, of Marseilles, and sister of the wife of
Joseph Bonaparte. He lived for a while in retirement, but
was summoned by the Government to Paris and was given
the command of the army of observation in Germany.</p>

<p>After the revolution of the 30th Prairial, in the year VII
(18 June, 1799), Bernadotte was appointed Minister of War;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
but the astute Siéyès was meditating a <i>coup d’état</i>, and mistrusting
Bernadotte, deprived him of his portfolio. He
accepted the title of Councillor of State from the First Consul,
and the command of the army of the West.</p>

<p>In 1804 Napoleon raised him to the dignity of Marshal of
the Empire, and gave him the command of the army in Hanover.
In June, 1806, he created him Prince of Pontecorvo,
and employed him in the war that broke out with Prussia.
It is unnecessary here to follow his career in the wars of
Napoleon. The Emperor never liked him, and even thought
of depriving him of the title he had conferred upon him.
He dispatched him in disgrace to Rome; but before he
reached it a deputation from Sweden arrived (September,
1810) with the tidings that King Charles XII had named him
Crown Prince, and that the Estates of Sweden had unanimously
ratified the appointment, with the condition that he
should resign his French citizenship and adopt the Lutheran
religion. To this he consented, and landed at Helsingborg
on 20 October, 1810, and on 5 November was recognized as
Crown Prince, and adopted the name of Charles John. By
arrangement with Russia Norway was detached from Denmark
and annexed to Sweden, much to the dislike of the
Norwegians.</p>

<p>In 1813 Sweden declared war against France, and Bernadotte
led 20,000 Swedes to join the allies; but his dilatoriness
caused him to be too late to take part in the Battle of the
Nations at Liepzig. He was naturally reluctant to cross
swords with his old master.</p>

<p>In 1814 he marched in the same leisurely manner into
France, and arrived in Paris after it had been occupied by
the allies. On 5 February, 1818, he succeeded his adoptive
father, and was crowned King of Sweden and Norway at both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Stockholm and Drontheim. He was succeeded by his only
son, Oscar, in 1844.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that both the two kings born at Pau
abjured their religions to obtain a crown. Henry IV abandoned
Calvinism to become a Catholic and receive the crown
of France; John Baptist Julius Bernadotte threw overboard
such Catholicism as he had&mdash;a light cargo&mdash;and
accepted Protestantism to obtain the crown of Sweden and
Norway.</p>

<p>Morlaas, six miles to the north-east of Pau, reached by a
light railway, was the ancient capital of Béarn. It has
dwindled to a poor village, but retains portions of its old
fortifications and an interesting church, founded in 1089,
that has a Romanesque crypt and west front. The church
had fallen into decay and the portal was much mutilated,
but it has been restored. A side chapel contains one of the
very few specimens of church furniture spared by the
Huguenots, because overlooked&mdash;an altar-piece of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The Pont-long I have already mentioned, an elevated moor
to the north of Pau, beyond the racecourse, that belongs to
the peasantry of the Val d’Ossau. On it may be seen the
shepherds pasturing their flocks in winter, when the mountain
herbage is buried under snow. These men formerly wore
their characteristic costume&mdash;a dark blue or brown <i>beret</i>,
like a tam-o’-shanter cap, a jacket of brown or scarlet, a
waistcoat of white wool, brown knee-breeches, and a bright-coloured
sash about the waist. They wore their hair long in
curls flowing over their shoulders. Now compulsory military
service has deprived them of their flowing locks, and the
blouse is gradually displacing the handsome traditional
costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
These men spend their time in knitting stockings whilst
watching their flocks. The sheep are horned, and have
pronounced Roman noses. A curious usage is for the dog to
precede the sheep instead of driving them.</p>

<p>There are numerous tumuli on the Pont-long. I opened
two in 1847, and found that they pertained to the Iron Age,
and were undoubtedly Gaulish. The floor was formed of
rolled stones, and on this were placed urns, some of great
size, containing burnt bones; they were red outside, black
within, and the clay was coarse; but with them was one
beautifully moulded little black vessel of the finest paste.
Beside two of the cinerary urns were hones of grit, rounded
on one side and flat on the other, with a groove running down
the middle.</p>

<p>The peasants had a legend anent the larger of the two that
I opened. Three men resolved on digging into it, and chose
for the purpose a stormy day when no one was likely to be
abroad and observe them.</p>

<p>They had not dug far before Pierre observed, “But we shall
surely find plenty of sous.”</p>

<p>“Des écus,” said Jacques.</p>

<p>“Des napoléons,” suggested Baptiste.</p>

<p>After some hours’ work they came on a flat slab, on raising
which a treasure of gold pieces was revealed. The men
plunged their arms in and could not reach the bottom of the
store. Gold, gold, ever more gold.</p>

<p>It was decided that a cart must be procured to remove the
treasure, and lots were cast as to who was to remain on the
tumulus, whilst the other two returned to Pau for a cart.
The lot fell on Pierre, and the others departed.</p>

<p>Evening had settled down when they returned with a
vehicle drawn by two oxen. Jacques and Baptiste discerned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
a dark figure on the mound, which they assumed to be that of
their companion left to guard the treasure.</p>

<p>Then, mounting the tumulus, they asked whether any one
had been there during their absence. The dark figure said,
“Look up!” The men turned, the figure threw back his
cloak, and they knew it was the devil, horns and hoof complete.
Before they could recover from their astonishment
and terror, with a switch of his tail he had whisked them into
the cart. He mounted himself, and instantly the oxen&mdash;their
own oxen&mdash;rose in the air with the vehicle, wheeled
thrice about the mound, and then suddenly descended,
carrying cart, men, and Satan into the pit. The earth closed
over them and they were seen no more. Only Pierre lived to
tell the tale. At the first appearance of the Evil One he had
crossed himself. He was flung from the tumulus, and lay
sprawling and blessing himself till after his comrades had
vanished.</p>

<p>Nay may easily be visited, as it is on the main road to
Tarbes. It has a church of the fifteenth century, and the
frontage of a Renaissance house in which Jeanne d’Albret
delighted to reside.</p>

<p>Farther on is Coarraze, where are the remains of the
château in which Henri Quatre spent his early boyhood.
Only the tower and the portal are of the sixteenth century,
the rest is a structure raised in the eighteenth century. Over
the doorway may be read the Spanish inscription: “Lo que
ha de ser no puede fallar.”</p>

<p>The church is early and fortified. The terrace in front of
the castle commands a beautiful and extensive prospect of
the Pyrenees in their ever-changing tints and lights and shades.</p>

<p>At the extreme limits of the department is Betharam.
The name has been supposed to be derived from the Arabic <i>Beit-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>Haram</i>,
the Holy House, and the place to have been a sacred
spot during the Saracen occupation of the land. If so, then
they bequeathed their veneration for the locality to the
Christians, who drove them from it, for Betharam has been
esteemed a holy house for centuries, owing to the possession
by it of a miraculous statue of the Virgin, about which one
of the usual childish tales is told that have such a family
likeness, and show such lack of variety. A shepherd saw
a blaze of light at the foot of a rock, and discovered that it
proceeded from an image. When the figure was removed
to the farther side of the Gave, with a leap into the air like
a field cricket it recrossed the river and returned to its station
under the rock. Then it was transferred to the high altar
of the parish church of Lestelle and locked in. But bolts
and bars could not restrain it; out it came through the key-hole
and made for its rock shelter again.</p>

<p>A church and convent were erected under the rock. In
1569, by order of Jeanne d’Albret, both were burnt; but
were rebuilt in 1614. The church is a barbaric structure,
immediately below a hill, surmounted by a Calvary. Here
formerly dwelt a hermit, who maintained himself by selling
tooth-combs of boxwood that he had made. But he is gone,
and has left no successor. The bridge at Betharam is greatly
admired, wreathed as it is with ivy, which falls in long tresses
and almost touches the Gave.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the view from the park at Pau. Finer
views may be had from the heights on the farther side of
the Gave, from Guindalos and Gelos; and in early spring,
when strolling among these hills, one may gather handfulls
of cyclamen, anemones, violets, and the white spires of the
asphodel.</p>

<p>On market-days at Pau may be purchased clumps of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
beautiful little scarlet anemone that formerly grew wild in
the vineyards, but has been so much in request that it has
disappeared, except under garden cultivation. And finally,
we must taste the wine of Jurençon and S. Faust, not in the
hotels at Pau, but in the village cabarets. It is much in
request, and is largely bought up by the Bordeaux wine
merchants, who mix it with thinner wines to give them richness
and body. It is of an amber colour, is strong, heady,
and delicious.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Oloron</span> is the ancient Iluro, in Gallo-Roman times one
of the twelve cities of Novempopulania, and of importance
as the key to the passage of the Pyrenees by the Val
d’Aspe over the Somport.</p>

<p>The Roman road branched off from the Via Aurelia at
Lescar, crossed the Gave de Pau, and struck direct for Oloron,
where, doubtless, soldiers and merchants and travellers in
general rested before undertaking the passage of the mountains.
The Roman road, after crossing the chain, descended
to the plains, and ran straight as a bird-line for Saragossa.
At Escot a Latin inscription remains, cut in the rock by the
wayside, commemorating the remaking of the road under
the direction of one, Valerius Vernus.</p>

<p>Oloron is a busy town, carrying on the manufacture of the
<i>beret</i>, the tam-o’-shanter, wherewith every Basque and
Béarnais covers his head.</p>

<p>The town is prettily situated at the junction of the Gave
d’Aspe and the Gave d’Ossau, which divide it into three parts.
One, Ste. Marie, was for long the communal centre and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
residence of the bishops of Oloron. The old feudal city is
staged up a hill between the two rivers. In it is the church
of Ste. Croix, built in 1080 by the Viscount Centule IV.
Centule had married a distant cousin, Gisela. But he coveted
the fair lands of Bigorre, to which Beatrix, daughter of Count
Bernard II, was the heiress.</p>

<p>Amatus, Bishop of Oloron and the papal legate, was in
want of a cathedral; so they put their heads together, and
Amatus undertook to obtain the annulling of the marriage
with Gisela by Pope Gregory VII. The Pope wanted money,
Centule wanted Bigorre, and Amatus a cathedral. Gregory
made no difficulties, so Gisela was repudiated, and sent to
end her days in a convent, as though she were the guilty
party. Amatus was paid for his help in this scandalous job
by being given a cathedral, and Centule, in the exuberance
of his delight at becoming possessed of the rich heiress, built
as well the church of Ste. Croix.</p>

<p>It was easy for any man with means in those days to
wriggle out of an union that was inconvenient. The Popes
had drawn up a catalogue of relationships within which
degrees marriage was prohibited, unless a dispensation had
been procured <i>argent comptant</i>. Kinship to the seventh
degree, affinity as well as consanguinity, could be pleaded.
Spiritual relationship through sponsorship at the font also
served. Right or wrong in the matter was not considered.
It was a contrivance of the Papacy for extortion of money.</p>

<p>The church of Ste. Marie is the ancient cathedral. The
most ancient portions belong to the eleventh century. Externally
it is not a striking edifice; nevertheless it is one of
the most curious in the South, and has just one splendid feature&mdash;the
sculptured porch, which is the basement of an enormous
and massive tower, pierced by arches. Beneath this is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
beautiful portal, round-headed, containing a double entrance,
the doorways parted by a pillar. The sculpture of tympanum
and archivolt are excellent for their period. A man
once caught, plucked, and cooked a nightingale. With such
a voice it ought to be excellent eating, he argued. But when
he set his teeth in it, his judgment on the nightingale was,
“Vox et præterea nihil.” So, with such a throat one might
reckon on a magnificent interior, but within the church
responds not at all to the conceptions raised by the portal,
and answers little to the idea formed of a cathedral.</p>

<p>But the diocese of Oloron was one of the poorest in all
France, and was just half the value of that of Lescar.</p>

<p>The quarter of Ste. Croix has narrow streets, with old houses,
some Romanesque, some Gothic, and others Renaissance.
It had been cramped within its walls, and could expand
upwards only. Now the fortifications have been demolished,
and but a single flanking tower remains.</p>

<p>The church is remarkable only for its Byzantine cupola.
In many points it recalls the Romanesque structures of
Auvergne. Anciently the only access to the nave was through
a richly ornamented door at the side. The western entrance
is a modern addition.</p>

<p>The third quarter of Oloron is modern, bright, and cheerful,
but uninteresting. In this quarter some houses bear the
escutcheons of foreign powers, for three states speaking
Spanish have their vice-consuls here&mdash;Spain, that entertains
active relations with the valleys of Ossau and Aspe; and the
Argentine and Uruguay republics, that are draining Béarn
of so many of its natives for settlers. Moreover, Oloron
is the principal centre for the making of the <i>beret</i>, as already
said, also of bright-coloured handkerchiefs much affected by
Spanish women in the New as in the Old World.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Oloron was a bishopric as early as 506. Marguerite de
Valois, Queen of Navarre, appointed to it Roussel, the reformer,
who began as a disciple of Calvin, and finished by
entering into unseemly wrangling with him over some petty
question in theology in a series of acrimonious letters. Marguerite
had to interfere, and entreat both to cease their
scurrility as an offence to religion. Roussel, as bishop, did
his utmost to detach the people from their ancient faith,
which he had sworn to maintain when consecrated, but which
at the very moment when he took oath he had resolved on
overthrowing.</p>

<p>He was preaching one day at Mauleon, assailing Catholic
doctrine with vehemence. A gentleman named Matye was
present, and unable to endure this without a protest, and
being armed with an axe, struck at the slim pedestal of the
pulpit with the butt-end, and with such force as to send
Roussel a bound into the air. When he came down, again
descended the axe, sending the bishop another leap, like a
pea on a drum. Roussel’s nerves were so shaken that he
fled the church, and galloped off to a Pyrenean watering-place,
there to recover the shock. But instead of recovering
he died, 1549. A suit was brought against Matye in the
Parliament at Bordeaux, for having frightened the bishop
into his grave; but nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Under Jeanne d’Albret the bishopric was suppressed;
however, a bishop was appointed in 1599. Oloron ceased to
be an episcopal seat at the Revolution.</p>

<p>The Val d’Aspe begins at Escot. At the foot of the mountain
of Narpayt stands up a rocky needle, named after
S. Nicolas, separated from the road by a belt of tillage.
From this point the valley narrows; a bridge crosses the
river, over which runs the road to the Val d’Ossau. Pinnacles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of rock and bare precipices pierced with caves border the
Gave, that flows between the green lips of rich pastures.
A fine peak, the Trône-du-Roi, stands up on the left bank.
For the most part the mountain slopes are bare, growing
nothing but box shrubs, and yet at one time hence came the
tall pines that furnished the navy of France with masts.
They were improvidently hewn down, and floated in rafts
to Bayonne, and no thought was given to replanting, so that
they were completely exhausted in 1780.</p>

<p>At Sarrance the valley expands. The village borders a
sweep of the Gave, under the Signal de Sarrance, rising to
the height of 4210 feet, cleft by a ravine well wooded, and
with sweet green pastures. To the south is another peak,
clothed in forest, rising to 4380 feet.</p>

<p>The Val d’Aspe formed one of those independent commonwealths
of which in the Middle Ages there were so many in
the Pyrenees. It was under the suzerainty of the viscounts
of Béarn, but enjoyed complete self-government. In 1477
the Procureur-Général of Béarn claimed the forests as the
property of the viscount, but the inhabitants protested that
the Val d’Aspe existed before the viscounty had been constituted.
The case was tried in the court at Pau, and judgment
was given in favour of the little republic. The Aspois
always were proud and independent. But unhappily a fever
for emigration to South America has set in and has depopulated
the valley seriously. In 1862 the inhabitants numbered
11,368, but in 1901 they had fallen to 7977. And this
is not due to poverty, for there is not a beggar to be found in
the valley.</p>

<p>Sarrance takes its name from the situation&mdash;<i>sarrada</i> in
Béarnais is “narrow” and <i>ance</i> is a “passage.” A bridge
wreathed with ivy spans the stream, near a chapel. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
terrace shaded with plane trees has its walls ablaze with
snap-dragon, sprouting out of every crevice. From the
chapel a stair leads down to the riverside, where is a niche
containing a statue of the Virgin and Child, indicating the
spot where, according to tradition, the image of N.&nbsp;D. de
Sarrance was found.</p>

<p>The old monastery stands on an elevation at the southern
extremity of the village. There is a little grass-grown square
with a fountain in it. On one side of the square are untenanted
houses, formerly guest-rooms of the convent; on the
other is the monastery with its church. This latter is of no
interest, as the old church, considered to be the finest in
Béarn, was completely destroyed by the Calvinists. The
tower is absolutely hideous. In a side chapel is a rude black
Madonna, an object of superstitious devotion.</p>

<p>It was here that Marguerite, sister of Francis I and Queen
of Navarre, composed her <i>Heptameron</i>. This is what she says
in the <span class="locked">introduction:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On the first day of September, when the baths of the
Pyrenees begin to have their virtue, several persons&mdash;some of
France, some of Spain, and others from elsewhere&mdash;were
united at Cauterets, the marvellous waters of which have cured
sick who were given up by the doctors. When the party was
about to separate it was found that the floods were out so that
there was no reaching Tarbes. So, having halted awhile at the
Abbey of Saint Savin, the whole company met again at the
monastery of Notre Dame de Sarrance, in Béarn. In order to
reach Pau it was necessary that the bridge over the Gave
should be repaired, and this occupied ten days. In order to
relieve the tedium of our stay in the convent of monks, the
company arranged a time-table for proceedings. In the morning
we met in the rooms of the Lady Oysille, the eldest present.
An hour was spent in reading the sacred Scriptures. Then we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
heard Mass. At ten o’clock came dinner; after that every one
retired to his or her chamber about their own affairs. At noon
no one failed to go to the beautiful meadow, by the side of the
Gave, where the trees are so covered with foliage that the sun
cannot pierce through nor take the freshness out of the air.
There, seated at our ease, every one relates tales, either true or
invented to amuse, as did Boccaccio. At four o’clock the merry
tales are interrupted in order that we may pray; and no one
fails devoutly to attend vespers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There are certain points to be noted in this. In the first
place, neither here nor anywhere else, does the Queen let fall
a word by which one can see that she appreciated the beauty
of the mountain scenery through which she travelled. Yet
the localities for some of her tales are Cauterets, Sarrance,
Odos, and Pau.</p>

<p>In the next place, the stories that these ladies told, and
which the Queen of Navarre collected, are so indecent, and
contain such foul expressions, that we are amazed to think
that any woman, however corrupt may have been the times,
should not blush to hear, and be ashamed to write them down.</p>

<p>And lastly, what a jumble of occupations! Bible-reading
in the morning, obscene stories in the evening, and then&mdash;prayers.</p>

<p>The meadow is there still, and one may sit in it now as
then; but now it is with thoughts of thankfulness on the
change that has been accomplished in manners and in sense
of decency. A little above Sarrance, on the east, opens the
entrance to a cirque. The southern wall, which is most
precipitous, supports a plateau strangely regular in form,
like a cone with its head sliced off, 4700 feet high. On the
right bank of the Gave opposite Bedous are four little heights,
two pointed, one rounded, the other flattened at top. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
are eruptive dykes of ophite, a rock somewhat abundant in
this valley.</p>

<p>Bedous is now the most considerable place in the valley,
much more busy and fuller of inhabitants than the cantonal
capital Accous.</p>

<p>At Accous is an obelisk erected to the memory of the
Béarnais poet, Despourrins (1690&ndash;1759), who was a native
of the place.</p>

<p>One day an English general, crossing from Spain and
descending the Val d’Aspe, encountered a little shepherd boy
with quick eye and intelligent face, whom he questioned
about objects of interest in the neighbourhood. Pleased with
the lad, he invited him to enter his service as valet, and the
youth, who had a rough time at home, without more ado
clambered on to the box to travel to distant and unknown
regions. This little shepherd was called Loustaunau, and
he followed the officer to India. When his master died he
sought to make his fortune by starting a house of commerce
in the territory of the Mogul. Then war broke out between
the Emperor of Delhi and the Nabob of Lahore.</p>

<p>Chancing to witness a battle between them from an eminence,
Loustaunau remarked to a Banian that the disposition
of the Mogul army was faulty. “If,” said he, “I had the
command of 1200 horsemen, and had a couple of cannon, I
would soon determine the battle.” What he had said was
reported to the Great Mogul, who at once gave him what he
desired. The Béarnais jumped on the back of a horse, took
the command of a troop, and ranged it behind a bit of rising
ground, placed his guns where he could rake the enemy, and
charged the centre of the enemy, and broke it, whilst his
cannon pounded the troops of the Nabob. The victory was
complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Loustaunau was richly rewarded, and given a princess to
wife, by whom he had several children. In a battle fought
against the Maharattas he lost his left hand, and had it replaced
by one of silver.</p>

<p>A quarter of a century had elapsed since he left the
Pyrenees; he had amassed a fortune, and a longing came
over him to revisit his native valley. Accordingly he returned
to France and invested his money in factories, and in
châteaux that he purchased within Béarn and in Bigorre.</p>

<p>But disaster came. His factories were burnt by the
Spaniards, and his fortune melted away. He meditated a
return to India, and started for the East. But unhappily
he made the acquaintance of Lady Hester Stanhope, who
gained complete possession of his mind. Forgetting the
needs of his family, and the object of his journey, he stayed
with her at the foot of Lebanon, where he led the life of a
prophet and <i>illuminé</i>. Lamartine met him there, and there
he died. He had left his children at Tarbes. Three of his
daughters were alive in 1860, living in poverty, maintaining
themselves by needlework, and looking back sadly on their
early days as a dream out of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.</p>

<p>The village of Osse, planted between strangely shaped
hills of ophite, facing the south, is the last refuge of Protestantism
in the valley. The population is 560, the majority of
whom are Calvinists, and they maintain a pastor and have
a “Temple.”</p>

<p>Urdos, the Forum Ligneum of the Ancients, is the last
town in France. The fortress commanding the pass is hewn
in the natural rock, in a buttress of the mountains rising in
stages from the road to the height of 500 feet. Externally
the mountain gives little token of what it is, honeycombed
with galleries, batteries, stairs. A façade of masonry battlemented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
and flanked by turrets at the foot of the rock, and a
few loopholes and embrasures for cannon, pierced in the face
of the cliff, are all that show that this is a French Gibraltar,
capable of containing a garrison of 3000 men.</p>

<p>Mauleon, the ancient capital of the little viscounty of Soule,
that passed to Béarn, is prettily situated on the banks of
the Saison, at the foot of a hill that is crowned by a castle
reached by a bridge over the moat or chasm artificially cut
in the rock.</p>

<p>The huge roofs of the Hôtel d’Andurrain form the hat to a
Renaissance building.</p>

<p>Mauleon, after remaining stagnant for centuries, has begun
to stir, and has become the centre of manufacture of the
espadrillos, or shoe with canvas top and twisted rope sole,
so much in use in the Pyrenees and in Spain.</p>

<p>A dozen years ago the whole population of Mauleon was
a thousand, and now two thousand men and five hundred
women are engaged in the factories; for in Senegal the natives
have all at once taken a fancy to the espadrillos, and the
fashion is spreading from Senegal; there is no saying where
it may end in wide Africa.</p>

<p>The workmen and women employed are not, however,
Basques or Béarnais, but are Spaniards. Here is trade, and
that a growing trade, in their midst, and the native population
shrug their shoulders, leave it to foreigners to carry on,
and depart for South America in shoals.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE VAL D’OSSAU</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The gap of the Val d’Ossau&mdash;Gan&mdash;Original course of the Gave&mdash;Buzy&mdash;Gorges
de Germe&mdash;Arudy&mdash;Destruction of forests&mdash;Boxwood&mdash;Cromlechs&mdash;Bielle&mdash;Independence
of the Republic of Ossau&mdash;Costume&mdash;Dances&mdash;Laruns&mdash;Eaux Chaudes&mdash;Beggary&mdash;Gabas&mdash;Eaux
Bonnes&mdash;Death of the Rev. Merton Smith.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Looking</span> south from the terrace at Pau one sees a noble
portal in the mountain chain apparently leading to
the roots of the Pic du Midi d’Ossau. But it is a mistake
to suppose that the drainage of those snowy crests can descend
at once into the Gave at one’s feet. Between the Val
d’Ossau and that of the Gave de Pau a region of hills intervenes.
Moreover, the valley that gapes does not lead to
the foot of that noble pyramid. It leads to Laruns only,
and there the broad trough ends, and above that the Gave
descends through a cleft painfully cut through intervening
strata.</p>

<p>On the railway from Pau to Laruns the first station is at
Gan. In this village, as I remember it fifty years ago, there
were but two houses with glass windows, the parsonage and
a Renaissance dwelling that belonged to Corisande d’Andouins,
one of the many mistresses of Henri Quatre. When
cold weather arrived, then the peasants closed their shutters,
perforated with a few holes&mdash;a heart, a cross, an S&mdash;and
through this opening derived their light. The train clambers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
up the heights past Buzy, and then all at once bursts on the
sight the broad Val d’Ossau&mdash;rich, fertile, smiling with maize
and vines, and villages, and beyond the Pic du Midi. The
Gave d’Ossau descending from the snowy range on the frontier
of Spain ran due north, as if to reach Pau in one direct channel,
but was arrested by the hills, and turned along the depression
at Buzy and turned westward where now goes the branch line
to Oloron. But dissatisfied with this bed, it tore at the rocks
near Arudy, and sawed for itself the Gorges de Germe, a
savage ravine, very tortuous, cut through hills covered with
woods. The abandoned bed was taken possession of by man.
It lies at a lower level than the actual channel, and the river
must have been deflected by immense piles of rubbish brought
down from the mountains. At the west end of the church at
Buzy may be seen a huge boulder rounded by rolling, used as
the pedestal to the village cross. The ancient channel furnishes
turf for fuel, and in it are grown beds of rank bulrushes.</p>

<p>Beyond Buzy, on the way to Arudy, is a dolmen already
referred to, but not on its original site. When the road was
altered it was removed and re-erected.</p>

<p>The train halts again at Arudy, only interesting for the
view, and for the tomb of a bishop, and a fifteenth-century
church with a reredos.</p>

<p>The Val d’Ossau in its lower parts is a wreck. The mountain
spurs on each side were once clothed with magnificent
forests of pine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Pyrenees,” says Michelet, “exhibit to us the disappearance
of the Old World. Antiquity is no more, the Middle
Age is at the point of death. The mountains themselves,
strange as it may seem, have their very existence attacked.
The fleshless peaks reveal the fact that they are in their senile
decay. It is not that they have failed to withstand the blows of
the storm, it is man who has assisted in their ruin from below.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
That deep girdle of forests which veiled the nakedness of the
ancient mother, has been plucked away by man. The vegetable
soil, which the herbage retained on the slopes, is now
carried below by the waters. The rock stands up bare;
chapped, exfoliated by the glare of the sun, by the tooth of
frost, undermined by the melting snow carried down by
avalanches. In the place of succulent pastures nothing
remains but a dry and ruined soil. The agriculturist who has
driven away the hunter, gains nothing thereby. The water
which formerly trickled down gently into the valley athwart
pastures and forests, now roars down in devastating torrents,
and covers the fields with the ruins it has made. A vast number
of hamlets in the high valleys have been abandoned,
through lack of fuel, and the inhabitants take refuge in the
lowlands, flying from the results of their own improvidence.</p>

<p>“In 1673 the mischief done caused alarm. Orders were
issued by Government that every inhabitant should annually
plant at once one tree in the domain, and two in the communal
lands. In 1669 and 1756 and still later new regulations made
give evidence to the panic caused by the progress of the evil.
But, at the Revolution, every barrier gave way, the population
being poor, set to work to enrich itself by completing the destruction
of the forests. They climbed, axe and firebrand in
hand, to the nests of the eagles, they swung over abysses,
hacking and destroying. Trees were sacrificed to the most
trivial needs. Two pines were cut down to make one pair of
sabots. At the same time the sheep and goats, multiplying,
fell on the forests, gnawed the trunks, devoured the young
trees, destroyed the shrubs, killed the future. The goat above
all, that most destructive of all creatures, and the most daring
of all, introduced a reign of terror into the mountains. That
was not one of the least of the labours of Bonaparte, when he set
to work to control the ravages of this beast. In 1813 the
number of goats had been reduced to a tenth of the number
that they had been in the year X. But he was not powerful
enough to put a finish to the war against Nature.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
The pines have been succeeded by boxwood that brings in
a certain revenue. It is not cut till the stem has attained a
girth of three inches; but it would be well if it were allowed
to reach a girth of four or five, as it serves as a valuable cover
for young pines where attempts are made to replant. The
box never grows very high, but some bushes arrive at the
height of fifteen feet, and a girth of trunk of fifteen inches.
The wood is made use of for the turning the beads of the
rosaries, made at Betharam, Saumur, and Lalouvesc in the
Boutierès. It cannot be utilized till the stem has arrived at
the diameter of a two-franc piece. In 1892 the boxwood from
Laruns sold for 3185 francs, but in 1895 for not more than
a thousand francs.</p>

<p>At Louvie Juxon and above Bielle and Bilhères, near the
entrance of Benon, are what the French call cromlechs,
circles of stones, supposed to be prehistoric monuments.
These are, however, very small, the stones insignificant, and
the shepherds of the district state that precisely similar
stones are planted by themselves about temporary huts of
branches and turf that they erect when obliged to spend
nights as well as days on the mountain.</p>

<p>Bielle was the ancient capital of Ossau. This valley was a
republic under the suzerainty of the viscounts of Béarn.
It governed itself, and had its own courts of justice, and
absolutely refused to suffer the soldiers of the viscount to
enter their little republic. He himself was not recognized
till he had sworn to respect its rights and privileges as contained
in the ancient <i>fors</i>.</p>

<p>At the present day a candidate for election to the Assembly
addresses the electors always as “Messieurs d’Ossau.” It was
by this title that the princes of Béarn spoke to them. In
Ossau there were no nobles; there was no appeal from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
judgment of their court to Viscount of Béarn or to the King
of France.</p>

<p>The constitution of former days still exists in regard to
communal property. This is divided into two categories:
the particular mountains belonging to each separate commune,
and the general mountains in the canton of Laruns
pertain to a syndicate formed of representatives of seventeen
parishes. In addition the Ossalois own the lande of Pont-long,
of which I have already spoken. In recognition of
their having ceded to Gaston Phœbus, or before him to the
first viscount who built a castle at Pau, sufficient ground for
his castle and park, they obtained the privilege to sit at table
with their viscounts.</p>

<p>The valley bottom is fertile, but tillage is pursued only
there. Cattle and sheep spend the summer on the high
pastures, and the sheep are driven in winter to the Pont-long.</p>

<p>Costume is fast disappearing. On Sunday at Bielle and
Laruns may be seen the old women still wearing their scarlet
<i>capulets</i> lined with silk and edged with black velvet; the
black corset is faced on the breast with crimson silk. A
woollen skirt descends in symmetrical folds to a little way
below the calf; the leg is clothed in white stockings, unfooted,
that widen over the foot. The male costume is quite gone.
The only part retained is the <i>beret</i>. It is a pity, for the costume
was admirably adapted to the men’s life in the mountains.
The thick, red, brown, and white jackets, waistcoats,
and breeches were of home make and handloom weaving,
from the wool of their own sheep, and lasted for years without
becoming threadbare.</p>

<p>Even the musical instruments general when there was a
dance have gone, the <i>tambouri</i> of six strings, struck by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
fiddlestick, whilst a piper played a flageolet of four holes,
from which he could draw six or seven notes. The great
fête at Laruns is on 15 August, and if the charm of this is
gone with the abandonment of the pretty costumes, it is
still an animated and gay scene.</p>

<p>At Laruns the broad trough of the Val d’Ossau comes
abruptly to an end. Here from the left comes down the
Valentin of Eaux Bonnes in a series of cascades, the drainage
of the snows of the noble mountains at the head of the Val
d’Azun, where they spill westward. But the Gave d’Ossau,
that has its source under the Pic du Midi, has sawn for itself
a way through rocks, and gushes forth through a notable
chasm directly above Laruns. This, the ravine in which lies
the thermal establishment of Eaux Chaudes, is by far the most
interesting, it gives access to the elevated village of Gabas,
and to the Col d’Aneou, by which one can pass into Spain.
All the upper part of the course of the Gave is of surpassing
beauty, and the Alpine pastures yield rich spoil to the botanist,
owing to the variety of geological formation, limestone,
schist, granite, and porphyry.</p>

<p>The road to Eaux Chaudes, made in 1847, has been in part
superseded by one made later, but for pedestrians it is the
most pleasant, as it is the shortest. It enters the Gorge du
Hourat, and runs the whole way between precipitous walls
of rock, beside the torrent which roars down with tremendous
velocity. At one point the road has had to be built up against
the side of the precipice as a bridge, to allow a torrent,
which falls from a height of several hundred feet, to pass
under it, and so join the Gave, the river that has formed the
cleft of the valley. At Eaux Chaudes there is little space;
in winter hardly any sun, in summer there is a sense of oppression
from the contraction of the mountains and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
exclusion of distant view. But many delightful excursions
may be made from it. Eaux Chaudes owes its origin to Henri
Quatre, who required his chancellor, the Bishop of Oloron,
to build there an establishment for one of Henri’s many
mistresses, la Fousseuse, that she might there drink the
waters.</p>

<p>The sturdy independence and self-respect of the peasantry
of Ossau have been broken down sadly by the influx of visitors.
Mr. Blackburn observes truly <span class="locked">enough:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is said that English visitors have completely demoralized
the Valley of Chamounix, and that the <i>curés</i> are in despair;
but whatever sins we have committed in Switzerland, the
French people have done worse, the difference between the
two nations being this, that the latter enjoy indiscriminate
almsgiving, and we do not. The result in this valley is demoralizing
to an extent that would scarcely be credited excepting
by eye-witnesses. As we drive along we see the
peasantry leaving their work in the fields at the sound of approaching
wheels, and crouching at the roadside in attitudes
of pain and misery; girls and boys leave their play to follow
the carriages, and whine for <i>quelquechose</i>; crops are half-gathered,
and work of all kinds is neglected during the season of
the sous; the cry is everywhere, ‘Give, give!’</p>

<p>“A girl of sixteen, well dressed and evidently well-to-do,
comes up with a bouquet of wild flowers; she asks ten sous for
it (about the wages of a day’s work), but will take no less; and
on receiving the money will immediately ask for the bouquet
back again, to sell to some one else.</p>

<p>“And this is not all, for those of the inhabitants who have
not brought up their children to the liberal profession of
begging, have invented another ingenious and profitable mode
of life, that of turning the cascades in the neighbourhood into
penny peepshows, shutting them off so that they can only be
approached by a wicket gate kept by one of themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the pleasantest short walks is to the Grotte des
Eaux Chaudes, passing before a little cave from which issues
a stream that proceeds at once to dash headlong down the
crags into the Gave. Beyond this is the large cave opening
in the face of a cliff. This grotto is traversed by a stream
which may be crossed by a bridge of wood to where, in the
depth of the cave, it leaps down out of a fissure in the wall in
a cascade. It is probably fed by the drainage of the Plateau
d’Anouillas, where the water descending from the Pic de
Gers disappears. When the stream has left the cavern it
again dives underground, and flows below the rocks in stages
that descend to the bottom of the valley, and reappears
only just before it enters the Gave. But the finest excursion
from Eaux Chaudes is to Bious-Oumettes, a plateau whence
a superb view is obtained of the Pic du Midi d’Ossau. This
peak is 9800 feet high, of porphyry and granite, cleft by a
profound vertical fissure, and is perhaps the finest, certainly
the quaintest, of the Pyrenean mountains.</p>

<p>Gabas, the last village on the French side of the chain,
is a halting-place for travellers and for muleteers conveying
goods from Spain. It is a cantonment of custom-house
officers; and here may be seen picturesque groups of shepherds
in their fleecy jackets, Spaniards in their richly-coloured
blankets, and the uniformed douaniers. The path leading
to the plateau is lined with fir trees, but on all sides may be
seen the ravages of fire, the axe, and winter storm, in charred
stumps, twisted or hewn-down trunks, thrown down to be
floated by the Gave through its stages to the lower valley.</p>

<p>The distance from Laruns to Eaux Bonnes is much the
same as it is to Eaux Chaudes. On reaching the former
watering-place&mdash;“Je comptais trouver ici la campagne,”
wrote M. Taine. “Je rencontre une rue de Paris et les<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
promenades du Bois de Boulogne!” It is a place of big
hotels, baths, pensions, shops where toys, trinkets, and
trumpery are displayed for sale, and, of course, a casino.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In whichever direction we turn,” says Mr. Blackburn,
“there are houses built into and often forming part of the
mountain, resting on ledges of rock, like to eyries; but so
cleverly contrived is the arrangement of the place, so admirably
has space been economized, that there is a feeling of
freedom about it, quite inconsistent with living in a bird’s
nest.</p>

<p>“Thus, with the mountains several thousand feet above our
heads, and the Val d’Ossau stretching away for many miles at
our feet, with rocks overhanging and tree-tops waving, through
which we can see the blue sky&mdash;with scarcely a foot of level
ground anywhere, save the Promenade Horizontale, with cascades
and waterfalls at our windows, we find ourselves as comfortably
and luxuriously housed as in any modern city.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of the church Taine says: “Cette église est une
boïte ronde, en pierre et plâtre, faite pour cinquante personnes,
ou l’on en met deux cents.” This box of stone and
plaster has disappeared to make room for one of more suitable
dimensions in what is caricature of Romanesque.</p>

<p>There is a good carriage road from Eaux Bonnes over a
fine pass into the Val d’Aruns and to Argelez. The chief
excursion is to the Pic de Gers, 8570 feet high.</p>

<p>The Eaux Bonnes springs have been known for centuries.
The Béarnais soldiers wounded in the battle of Pavia in 1525,
were sent here to be healed; and for some time after that the
springs went by the name of les Eaux d’arquebusades. But
they owe their modern renown to the works of Théophile
Bordeu. There are seven sources of sulphurated waters,
which are good for throat disorders, wounds, sores, and morbid
maladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
The Eaux Bonnes was the scene of a sad accident in 1883,
that happened to the Rev. Merton Smith, vicar of Plympton
S. Mary, in Devonshire. He had gone to the Pyrenees for
his month’s holiday, and visited this watering-place. On
8 August he left his hotel at 3 p.m., in his usual spirits, to
walk to Eaux Chaudes, and never returned. He had intended
to return the same evening.</p>

<p>Nothing could be heard of him. Inquiries were made in
all directions, search parties were organized; he could nowhere
be found. Months passed, and his disappearance
remained unexplained. The Bishop of Exeter was in perplexity
what to do. He could not institute to the living
without certain knowledge that Mr. Merton Smith was dead,
and this knowledge could not be obtained.</p>

<p>Uncharitable tongues wagged. Some said that he had
fallen a victim to the fascinations of a Pyrenean shepherdess,
and that he was picking edelweiss and playing a flute on some
high Alp to the delectation of the damsel. Some said that
he had been captured by Roman Catholics and interned in
a monastery. Some said that he had been murdered by
Ossau mountaineers for the sake of his money.</p>

<p>Not till eighteen months after his disappearance was the
mystery cleared up. His body was found on the mountainside,
buried among thick bushes of box that had concealed it.
He had apparently been stooping to pick a flower and had
fallen over a precipice and been killed instantaneously. His
watch and purse were intact. It was by chance only that a
woodcutter discovered the remains whilst clearing the boxwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Lourdes stands at the entrance to and is the key to the
Lavedan, so called from <i>abies</i>, the pines that once clothed
the mountain-sides. The Lavedan is fertile. It is the trunk
whence branch out numerous valleys that run up to the
roots of the mountains and receive their water. But Lavedan
formed a republic of seven of these valleys&mdash;Batsouriguère,
Castelloubon (through which flows the Nès), Estrom de
Salles, Azun, Saint Savin, Devantaïgue, and Barèges.</p>

<p>“Count” Henri Russell-Killough, in his <i>Fortnight Among
the Pyrenees</i>, describes the Lavedan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Vine, fig trees, cherry trees, poplars, willows, elms, walnuts,
maize, all meet here, and vegetation rises nearly to the tops of
the mountains. On a fine day the whole thing looks like a
modern Eden.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I remember Lourdes before it was “invented” by Bernadette
Soubirous and the <i>curé</i> Peyramale. It was a dead place,
with narrow streets, very dirty, clustered about the rock
on which stands the castle. Although the true capital of
the Lavedan, the market for all the produce of the Seven
Valleys, yet it seemed to be tenanted only by beggars.</p>

<p>Lourdes commands the roads which here unite from
Argelez, Tarbes, Pau, and Bagnères. It was a place of great
military importance, and was the last stronghold in Guyenne
retained by the English. It did not surrender till 1418. The
castle had been given to the English by the French king
John as part of his ransom, in conformity with the Treaty of
Bretigny, 1360, when the towns and barons of Gascony were
required to swear allegiance to the Black Prince, as representative
of the English king. After awhile the country rose
in revolt, exasperated by the exactions of the English, and
the Duke of Anjou, brother of Charles V, supported the
Bigorriens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
After that all the plain had been recovered by the French,
nothing remained to the English but the Castle of Lourdes,
the Lavedan to Barèges, far removed from their base at
Bayonne. The Duke of Anjou took the town easily, as it
was defended merely by a pallisade, but could not capture
the castle, which bade defiance to him during six weeks. He
vainly endeavoured to buy the governor, and was forced to
retire discomfited. The attempt made by Gaston Phœbus
and the murder of Pierre Arnaut de Béarn by him has been
already related.</p>

<p>But the castle has an earlier history. It is supposed to
have been a Roman castrum. It was occupied by the Saracens,
who retained it after their defeats at Poitiers and
Tarbes, till the reign of Charlemagne. He besieged it.
According to legend an eagle, flying above the highest tower
of the castle, dropped a fish on the battlement at a spot still
called Pierre de l’Aigle. Thereupon the Moorish commandant
Mirad sent a messenger to Charlemagne to say that he
might understand how vain were his expectations of reducing
the garrison by famine, as the Prophet himself provided it
with food.</p>

<p>Charlemagne did not accept this view of the incident, and
continued the investment till the castle surrendered. The
Bishop of Le Puy had promised Charles the aid of Our Lady
of Puy, if properly considered. “Give her something,” said
he, “if it be but a tuft of grass from the castle wall.”</p>

<p>Mirad and the garrison put wisps of hay about the points
of their lances, in token of submission. Then Charles bade
the bishop open his lap and threw into it all the hay from
the spear-heads. This was in 778.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century the castle (Mirabel is its name)
was converted into a state prison, and it became the Bastille<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
of Gascony. Since the empire it has served as a barrack for
a small garrison.</p>

<p>But it is not the castle that now attracts visitors to Lourdes,
but the Grotto of Massabiel, the story of which must be told
briefly.</p>

<p>Bernadette Soubirous was the daughter of a drunken,
dishonest miller, who had lost his mill through speculation,
and had been imprisoned. He and his family were living as
pensioners on the Abbé Peyramale, <i>curé</i> of Lourdes, in a
wretched cottage in a back street&mdash;five persons huddled into
one room. Bernarde, afterwards called Bernadette, was an
under-sized, ill-fed, unhealthy child of limited intelligence
and utterly uneducated. For some reason never explained
she was sent to Bartrès, where she was employed in tending
sheep. There she attracted the attention of the <i>curé</i> Ader,
who repeatedly declared his conviction that she was just the
sort of person to be vouchsafed a vision like that seen by
the shepherd children of La Salette.</p>

<p>At the end of January, 1858, the Abbé Ader sent Bernadette,
then aged fourteen, back to Lourdes, where she was at once
taken in hand by one of the <i>vicaires</i> of the place, the Abbé
Pomian, who became her confessor and director.</p>

<p>Singularly, perhaps significantly, on 28 December, 1857,
M. Falconnet, <i>procureur général</i> at Lourdes deemed it expedient
to send a report to the <i>procureur impériale</i> at Pau,
that something was brewing in the place. This is his <span class="locked">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have been informed that manifestations of a supernatural
character and of a miraculous aspect are being prepared
for the end of this year. I would advise you to take measures
that the facts should be closely watched. I must know the
details so as to be aware under what articles of the penal code
prosecution is possible. I fear that little help can be gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
from the administration civil or religious. Our duty is to do
all in our power to stop the recurrence of such scandals as those
of La Salette, the more so as the religious intrigue is a means of
hiding one that is political.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is evident from this letter that something was expected
at Lourdes. The magistrate was mistaken only as to when
it would take place, which was forty-five days after this
letter was written. On 11 February, 1858, a cold day,
Bernadette was dispatched along with her younger sister,
Marie, and a companion, Jeanne, to collect sticks for fuel
beside the Gave, under the rock of Massabielle. Bernadette
suffered from asthma, had a bad cough, and scrofulous sores
on her head. To reach their destination a small stream had
to be crossed. Marie and Jeanne slipped off their sabots and
went through the water, which was so cold that it made them
cry out. Bernadette stopped to remove her wooden shoes
and thick stockings. Beyond the stream rose a limestone
rock with a cave in the face, the floor of which was level with
the bank of the Gave. An oval opening above it allowed
light to penetrate from aloft into the recesses of the grotto.
At the entrance to this hole grew a rose bush.</p>

<p>Whilst stooping to take off her stockings, the rush of blood
to her head made the child fancy that she heard a sound as
of wind, and looking up she imagined that she saw a light in
the upper hole, and a lady standing in it, robed in white,
wearing a blue sash, a veil over her head, with a rosary
in one hand, and golden roses on her feet.</p>

<p>To her excited fancy it seemed that the apparition smiled
and made the sign of Redemption with the cross of the rosary.
Bernadette uttered an exclamation, traversed the stream,
told her companions what she had seen, and asked them if
they observed the lady. “No,” they replied, “we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
seen nothing.” Then Bernadette said, “No more did I,
either.”</p>

<p>On their return to Lourdes, Marie told her mother what
Bernadette had stated, and Mme. Soubirous treated it as
idle fancy.</p>

<p>The matter, however, was noised about and provoked
attention, the more so as from the magistrate’s letter we are
made aware that something of the sort was expected in the
place. On Sunday, 14 February, a party accompanied the
girl to the spot; whereupon she knelt down, fell into an
ecstasy, and declared that she again saw the apparition. All
Lourdes was now stirred. Three ladies next took Bernadette
in hand, and were almost constantly in attendance on her&mdash;Mme.
Millet, Mlle. Peyret, and Mlle. Pène, sister of one of the
curates of Lourdes. In their presence Bernadette had other
visions. Peasants now came in crowds, surrounded the girl,
and accompanied her on each expedition to the grotto. At
the suggestion of her confessor she put questions to the figure,
and it replied, so Bernadette asserted, enjoining penance,
and the building of a chapel on the spot.</p>

<p>One day “Madame,” said the child, “if you have something
to communicate to me, have the goodness to write it
down.”</p>

<p>“There is no need for writing what I have to tell you,”
replied the mysterious lady; “but do me the favour of
coming here during fifteen days.”</p>

<p>On one occasion the apparition bade the girl go into the
grotto, grub for water, wash in it, drink it, and eat a mouthful
of grass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Grotto at this period,” said Mlle. Lacrampe, who was
present on this occasion, “had not the depth that it possesses
now. Pebbles and sand were heaped up in it to a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
height, so much so that one speedily reached a point where it
was necessary to bend double to get further. Bernadette,
after having raised her eyes to the niche, put her hand to her
hood to arrange it, and lifted her gown a little so as not to soil
it. Then she stooped to the earth, and when she raised her
head and turned her face towards the apparition, I saw that
her face was all smudged with dirty water.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Bernadette herself <span class="locked">related:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The lady told me to drink of the fountain and to wash in
it. Not seeing any spring, I was going to the Gave, but she
signed to me to enter the cave. I entered and saw only a little
dirty water. I put my hand to it, but could collect none, so I
scratched, and the water came, but it was muddy. Thrice I
rejected it. Only on the fourth attempt could I swallow
any.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jesuit father Cros says with regard to this exhibition:
“Mademoiselle Lacrampe se retira si défavorablement impressionée,
qu’il a fallu des années et des miracles pour la
convaincre.” M. Estrade, receiver of indirect taxes, says with
respect to this affair: “Je commerçais à être dérouté, et
ne savais que penser de tout ceci.”</p>

<p>Thus was the miraculous spring discovered, the water of
which, or what is supposed to come from it, is sent throughout
the world, a case of thirty bottles carriage paid to the
station 7 fr. 45 c. One bottle, “franco à domicile,” in
France 1 fr. 80 c.</p>

<p>Now it is absolutely certain that the water was there before
Bernadette Soubirous scratched till she reached it. The
Abbé Richard, a geologist, says that it was there and it was
known to be there by many individuals in Lourdes.</p>

<p>On 25 March Bernadette made her seventeenth visit to
the grotto. The <i>curé</i> Peyramale had been at her repeatedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
insisting that she should ask the apparition who and what
she was.</p>

<p>Accordingly on this occasion she said: “Madam, kindly
inform me who you are?”</p>

<p>Then the figure crossed its hands over the breast, lowered
the eyes, and said: “Je suis l’Immaculée Conception, et je
désire une chapelle ici.”</p>

<p>It is deserving of notice that the apparition did not state
that she was the Blessed Virgin, but that she was an abstraction,
the manifestation in visible form of a dogma.</p>

<p>Now Bernadette had been subjected for some time to
strong suggestion. She had been influenced by the Abbé
Ader at Bartrès, who had announced that she was just the
sort of person to be chosen by the Blessed Virgin to see her;
then she had been under the direction of the <i>vicaire</i> Pomian,
and the strong personality of the <i>curé</i> Peyramale, who could
mould such a feeble creature as wax. I do not imply that they
consciously provoked a fraud; far from it. I think that these
clergy had made up their minds that Bernadette was a suitable
subject to be favoured by a vision, and had let her understand
what their opinion of her was. Indeed, the schoolmaster
at Bartrès, in his simplicity, wrote as much in the
<i>Guide du Pèlerin à Lourdes</i>. The fathers of Garaison, who
“ran the show,” to use a vulgar expression, were so alarmed
at this revelation, that they brought up and destroyed every
copy of the <i>Pèlerin</i> on which they could lay their hands.
According to J. de Bonnefon, <i>Lourdes et ses tenanciers</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Somewhat later, the Abbé Ader, dissatisfied, neglected, forgotten,
was filled with scruples, and told everything.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">What his authority for this statement is I do not know,
but this is certain, that Ader was hurriedly removed from
his <i>curé</i>, and sent hastily to the Benedictines, and kept in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the abbey of Saint Benoît for two years, without occupation,
but lodged and fed and entertained, not at his own cost. At
the end of that time he was thought to be no longer dangerous,
and was appointed <i>curé</i> of Oroix, a little place with not two
hundred inhabitants, in a remote corner of the diocese, miles
from every highroad. That Bernadette had heard of the
apparition at La Salette is certain, even if she had not heard
Ader liken her to one of those who saw that apparition,
which took place in 1846, and was preached about and talked
of everywhere. I spent a summer in a château in the valley
of Argelez in 1850, and the <i>curé’s</i> mind was full of it. He
lent me a book concerning it, and became hot in defence of
the veracity of the children.</p>

<p>Representations of the vision of La Salette were set up in
churches&mdash;statues and pictures and stained glass. Bernadette
was a constant attendant at church, and must have
heard of this event.</p>

<p>Again, but three years previously, Pius IX had proclaimed
the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception as <i>de fide</i>, and
every pulpit was ringing with it. What it meant Bernadette
did not know. But in her narrow, uncultivated mind it took
form as a prime verity of the faith which was disputed by
those who were weak in their belief&mdash;who were not good
Catholics.</p>

<p>What could have been expected under such influences, but
that if the child fancied she saw a vision, that vision would
proclaim the doctrine recently promulgated. Can it for a
moment be doubted that if she had heard the efficacy of a
certain medicine vaunted, seen it everywhere advertised,
had it urged on her from the pulpit and in the class and in
the confessional, she would have heard the apparition say,
“Je suis l’infallible pilule pink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
That Bernadette was an impostor cannot be admitted;
no one who knew her, none even of those who disbelieved in
the apparition, had any doubt on that score. But she was
epileptic, hysterical, and subject to hallucinations. She was
very different from Melanie and Maximin Mathieu of La
Salette, whom the saintly <i>curé</i> d’Ars saw, and was at once
convinced that they were liars. Very similar visions to
that seen by Bernadette had been seen by Huguenots. In the
spring of 1668, near Castres, a young shepherdess of La Capelle,
aged ten, beheld an angel who forbade her going to Mass.
The news spread through the country, and, just as at Lourdes,
so at La Capelle, crowds assembled to see her in an ecstasy,
and hear her converse with the angel, who bade her announce
to all to avoid entering Catholic churches.</p>

<p>Roman Catholics would say that the girl was deceived by
the devil, and that Bernadette’s visions were from heaven.
But in fact one was as genuinely a delusion as the other.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the case of Bernadette was not examined
coolly and impartially. Very soon a doctor, Dozous, took up
the cudgels for the miracle. Here is what the <i>procureur
impériale</i> says of him, and from that one can judge of the
worth of his evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Doctor Dozous was formerly physician at the hospital of
Lourdes, but was dismissed his post two years ago. He has
resented this bitterly, I understand. Nor was he pleased that
he was passed over and three of his confrères were nominated
by the prefect to report on the physical and moral condition
of Bernadette Soubirous. Be that as it may, he has made a
change in his opinions since then. He did call these visions farces,
now they are something beyond the power of human nature
to explain. On 7 April he was for the first time struck with
a circumstance that had previously not struck him or any one
else. Bernadette, during her ecstasy, held a lighted candle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
between her hands, and the flame licked her hands without
burning them. Other spectators, quite as well situated as
M. Dozous, assert that he saw incorrectly, or ill appreciated
what he did see.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On 12 March, 1858, the Emperor Napoleon III demanded
information relative to the affair of Lourdes. Somewhat
later the Empress was at Biarritz, and had with her as attendant
Mme. Bruat, who had just returned from Lourdes,
bringing with her some of the grass that grows in the grotto.
It fell out one night that the Prince Imperial was ill, and
croup was feared. Mme. Bruat urged the application of the
herb from Lourdes. The Emperor was roused, and in his
presence the bit of dried grass was applied to the lips of the
child, and he became easier.</p>

<p>The Emperor and Empress at once extended their protection
to the grotto, and all serious examination into the matter
was at an end. This was on 2 August. The consequences
were immediately felt. None of the civil authorities at
Tarbes or Lourdes dared thenceforth express doubts in the
genuineness of the apparition. It had a further effect.
There existed a good number of documents in the <i>dossier</i> at
Tarbes relative to what had been going on at Lourdes, very
candid accounts&mdash;perhaps too candid. One compromising
packet disappeared, and was offered privately for sale to
several persons. The police were at once set to work, and
secured the stolen packet, which was <i>not</i> restored to its place,
but totally and irretrievably disappeared.</p>

<p>In 1869 appeared Lasserre’s book, <i>Notre Dame de Lourdes</i>,
which had an enormous sale; it had reached its 126th edition
in 1892. Henri Lasserre had been a journalist, and his paper,
the <i>Contemporaine</i>, had utterly failed. He was in bad circumstances,
when the bright idea struck him to puff Lourdes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
He went there in August, 1867, and placed himself in the house
of the <i>curé</i> Peyramale, and took in without criticism everything
that he was told. He did more; he dressed up every
incident fantastically, turned the story into a romance,
giving details and conversations that could only have been
obtained had he tracked Bernadette from day to day with a
camera snap-shotting her, and with a note-book and pencil
taking down everything heard in shorthand. He made no
scruple to falsify facts which did not suit him, and he had his
reward; the book sold with an unprecedented rapidity, and
filled his pockets with gold. Now the Jesuit Cros also wrote
about Lourdes; but his work, that appeared in 1901, while
exposing many of Lasserre’s falsehoods and exaggerations,
had to be gone through and cut about by his superiors before
that it was suffered to be published.</p>

<p>It causes some surprise, and it convinces some people that
miraculous agency has worked in the grotto, in that so much
water flows away from the taps supposed to discharge that
which issues from the spring in the cave. This water is
drawn off, evaporated, and sold in pastilles (big boxes, 2
francs; <i>bonbonnières</i>, 75 cents). But does it really come
from the source pretended? The water of the cave is merely
the dripping and sweating of the walls and the oozing up of
infiltration of the Gave, that is little lower than the floor;
but hence now issues a copious spring.</p>

<p>An experienced scientist of Bayonne managed to break
through the wire netting at the end of the grotto that conceals
the miraculous spring from the public, and to pour in sufficient
fluorescine to discolour 10,000 litres of water. This would
have revealed itself at the taps infallibly, had this latter
supply come from the grotto. No discoloration, however,
appeared. The gentleman who made this experiment wrote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
to the superior of the Fathers of the Grotto to inform him of
the test he had applied. He received no answer. Then, in
a second letter, published in the <i>Reveil de Bayonne</i>, he offered
to pay the superior the sum of 40,000 francs if he would allow
the matter of the water to be properly investigated, and could
prove that there was no trickery. The water, he asserted,
was drawn from the Gave higher up stream. The Fathers
shrank from the investigation.</p>

<p>My authority for this is Jean de Bonnefon. But I must
add that I wrote to that gentleman and also to the editor of
the <i>Reveil de Bayonne</i> to learn the name of the man who
offered the challenge, and also the date when made, and that
neither one nor the other has had the courtesy to reply. The
editor may, however, be dead, as the <i>Reveil</i> has ceased to
appear.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the charge of fraud has been made publicly
by M. de Bonnefon, and it is incumbent on the French Government
to see that no trickery is used to impose on the religious
public, and obtain of it money under false pretences.</p>

<p>The Fathers of Garaison are no longer nominally in charge of
the grotto and all its belongings, but this is nominally only.
They are now called <i>vicaires</i>, under authorization of the Bishop
of Tarbes. The name is altered, that is all. Monte Carlo is
under the protection of the French Government. A German,
Captain Weihe, has brought charges against the Company of
fraudulent action, of having the balls loaded and of employing
magnets. The French Government should insist before
extending its patronage to the gambling hell at Monte Carlo
and to the grotto of Lourdes to have the proceedings in both
thoroughly and impartially investigated. But both bring
vast sums of money into the country, and consequently the
Government shuts its eyes upon both. When the inventories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
were taken in the spring of 1906 the Bishop of Tarbes gave
instructions that no sort of opposition was to be offered at
Lourdes to the Government authorities counting up the silver
hearts, and crutches, etc., in the basilica and grotto. It
mattered not to him to have the feathers of the goose counted,
so long as the goose itself was not killed that laid the golden
eggs. He was careful not to provoke opposition, lest an inquiry
should be made that might lead to awkward disclosures.</p>

<p>Not that any amount of exposure of trickery&mdash;if trickery
has been resorted to&mdash;would disabuse the minds of the
credulous. Human stupidity is too crass for that; but it
would relieve the French Government of the discredit of
conniving at dishonest proceedings.</p>

<p>Before Lasserre’s book had appeared, the Bishop of Tarbes
had appointed a commission to investigate the alleged
marvels at Lourdes, but there was not a name on the commission
that could command confidence, only a vicar-general,
canons of the cathedral, and the like, not a single man of
science and of independent mind. When the bishop was
satisfied&mdash;and most easy to satisfy he was&mdash;he gave his
sanction to pilgrimages to the grotto, and Pius IX accorded
indulgences to such as made the visit. He did more; he
instituted a liturgical office for 11 February, to be inserted
in the Breviary, in commemoration of the first apparition.
Consequently the Church of Rome is irrevocably committed
to this great delusion.</p>

<p>It was necessary to get rid of Bernadette; she was not indeed
likely to “faire des bêtises”; but, in her own interest,
it was well that she should be removed, lest her head should
be turned, as people were entreating her to perform miraculous
cures. And it was quite possible that she in her simplicity
might let out compromising avowals&mdash;not indeed that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
whole thing had been got up as a fraud, for that it was not,
but might avow how greatly she had been influenced by the
suggestive action of the abbés Ader, Pomian, and Peyramale,
all doing their part in good faith, with no intent of deception
but who, like Ader, had become, conscious <i>après coup</i> that
they had brought this affair about.</p>

<p>Bernadette was taken off and shut up in a convent at
Nevers, at such a distance from her home that there seemed
no chance of relative or acquaintance ever seeing her again.
There she was retained very close; hardly any one was permitted
to visit her. Her health, always frail, gave way in
confinement, deprived of her mountain air, and she died in
1879. When it was known that she was on her death-bed
M. le Gentil very kindly undertook to pay the expenses of
her brother to Nevers, so as to have a last look at his sister.
Gentil accompanied him. Nevers would seem to have been
chosen expressly as a place where to place Bernadette, so
difficult is it to be got at from Tarbes&mdash;only by cross lines and
slow trains, with long waits at every change. However
difficult and tedious Gentil and Soubirous may have found it,
making their way thither by train, it was nothing to the
difficulties caused by wilful obstruction put in their way on
reaching Nevers. Soubirous went alone to the convent, and
asked for the superior. She replied to his demand for an
interview with his dying sister, “It is against the rules of
the convent.”</p>

<p>Soubirous, timid as poor peasants are, returned to the hotel
and told M. Gentil his want of success. Soubirous went again
to the convent and was again refused. Then the two men
called at the palace on the bishop. He said, “I can do
nothing. The superior is mistress in her house.”</p>

<p>Then Soubirous and his companion went again to the convent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
and entered the parlour, where they declared firmly that
they would remain till the request was granted.</p>

<p>The superior in great agitation entreated them to depart
and not provoke a scandal. “I am but a feeble woman,”
she said, “and the bishop has forbidden me to allow you
to see your sister.”</p>

<p>Throughout the day the two men remained at their post
seated in the parlour. Emissaries ran to and fro between
the convent and the bishop’s palace. The house was like a
disturbed ant-heap. Sisters passed and repassed, peeped in
and withdrew. Voices were heard in discussion in the passages.
But the two men would not budge.</p>

<p>At last night drew on. It would never do to allow them to
pass it in this holy prison. At last, pale and trembling, the
superior entered, and said, “Monseigneur has consented.”</p>

<p>Soubirous was then conducted to the infirmary. The
whole community of twenty nuns, and all the serving sisters,
were there crowded about the bed. On it Soubirous caught
a glimpse of the white face of his sister with her great burning
eyes looking at him, and tears rolling down her cheeks. The
dying girl in a feeble voice said, “The fathers will give you
work. They have promised it.” That was all. The head
sank back on the pillow, and more tears flowed. Soubirous
was then hustled out of the room, and he never more saw
Bernadette.</p>

<p>To-day this man is well-to-do. He has a shop and a house,
and fears God and the Fathers of the Grotto. So ended this
poor martyr to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.<a id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a>
The annual number of pilgrims who visit the grotto amounts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
to something over 600,000, and the affluence increases every
year. Trainloads of sick people leave Paris in the month of
August, when the principal pilgrimage takes place. But all
the festivals of the Blessed Virgin, and that of the Apparition,
inserted in the calendar with proper Mass, give occasion to
solemnities of exceptional grandeur, the most imposing
feature of which is the night processions so beautifully
described by Zola. Hideous and vulgar are basilica and chapel
of the Rosary that have been erected over and by the cave.
The situation is exceptionally beautiful, and would lend itself
to a stately and well-proportioned church and pile of buildings;
but it has been used as an occasion for the display of architectural
ineptitude. Grotto and church are crowded with
<i>ex votos</i> memorials of cures wrought there, cures that are
reputed miraculous.</p>

<p>But who is to decide where the natural ends and the
miraculous begins? In the present condition of science we
cannot draw the line between the natural and the supernatural.
None can plant his walking-stick at a certain point
and say that he has reached “ubi defuit orbis,” and no man
can declare the exact point “ubi defuit scientia.” We know
that the Maladetta is in Spain, and that the Vingemale is in
France, because the mountain chain has been surveyed, and
the line of demarcation drawn between Spain and France.
Such a tree, such a rock, such a hamlet, we know for certain
is in one or other of these countries. But there is no such
boundary in Nature. Where does the vegetable realm end
and the animal kingdom begin? Psychology and physiology
overlap and interpenetrate one another. The body acts on
the mind, and the mind on the body. Those who come to
Lourdes come in a condition of nervous exaltation, in a fever
of faith and hope; not only so, but they come in crowds, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the magnetic, electric influence exercised by great masses of
men and women on one another, is prodigious, when all are
actuated by the same impulse.</p>

<p>That cures have been wrought at Lourdes I do not doubt.
Similar and as many, and as genuine cures were wrought of
old in pagan temples, which were also crowded with <i>ex votos</i>.</p>

<p>And what guarantee have we that these cures have been
permanent? A man with a rheumatic leg prays at the cave,
dips in the dirty pool, feels that he can walk, and hangs up
his crutches. Next day he is as much crippled as before,
but he has not the courage to go back to the grotto and
resume his crutch; he orders another from Paris.</p>

<p>But that some of the cures are permanent need not be
doubted. The effect of imagination on the body is immense.
Every nervous person can make himself ill by imagining
himself to be ill; and a good many can get well by persuading
themselves that they are convalescent. There was much
truth in Mrs. Chick’s saying that Mrs. Dombey died because
“dear Fanny wouldn’t make an effort.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A funicular</span> railway takes a visitor to the top of the
Pic de Gers, whence he can obtain a fine comprehensive
panorama of the mountains. A cross surmounts
the peak that is illuminated at night.</p>

<p>On quitting Lourdes to ascend the Valley of Argelez the
mountain sides are seen to be bare, having been denuded of their
trees by the ruthless axe of the peasant. Presently the train
passes a mound on which stands a solitary tower called after the
Black Prince, who is held to have ordered its construction to
watch the upper portion of the valley. Then the basin of
Argelez opens up, with villages and culture, vines, chestnuts,
walnuts, running high up the sides of the mountains, mainly
on the right bank of the Gave, and maize in the plain standing
up as high as a man, or in the season sheets of forget-me-not-blue
waving flax, alternating with crimson stretches of the
<i>Trifolium incarnatum</i>. On the rubbly slopes the glistening
box flourishes luxuriantly. Argelez is a delightful resort in
spring and summer. It has its bathing establishment, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
which the waters of Gazost are led, its casino, and a park in
which the bamboos grow rank, and the acacias in spring
flower and scent the air. Avenues, bordered by hotels, link
the Argelez of the tourist and those who go there for what
the Germans call “Sommerfrische” with the old Argelez.
Among the villas is the château of Vieusac, from which
that scoundrel Barrère took a title, that he dropped in the
Reign of Terror, and reassumed as soon as he was safe under
Louis Philippe, when he represented Argelez in the Conseil
Général.</p>

<p>This place was formerly a Romano-Gaulish settlement;
in a field near the town a considerable number of cinerary
urns have been dug up. A mile below Argelez is the
Balandrau, a huge block of stone balanced at the edge of
a crag, held from falling by a small stone of different nature,
that retains it in position, and looking as though all it needed
was a touch to send it hurtling down upon the roof of a farmhouse
planted beneath. A Mass is said annually in the church
of Argelez to invoke Divine intervention against such a catastrophe.
The Balandrau has been supposed to be a megalithic
monument of the dolmen builders, but it is natural, a relic of
the Ice Age in the valley when it was choked with glaciers.
Farther down a stream flows into the Gave. Here, at
Ouzous, is an intermittent spring that turns a mill, when it
pleases it to flow. Before it bursts forth it is said to growl
and grumble. Here also, in the face of the limestone cliff, is
a cave that served as a church during the Reign of Terror,
when priests were hunted down like wolves; and here the
peasants assembled to hear Mass. Fifty years ago the rude
stone altar, made like that of Gilgal, was standing; I have
not been to the grotto since.</p>

<p>Facing Argelez, the right bank of the Gave to the crest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of the mountains, from Préchac to the mouth of the Valley
of Isaby constitutes one of the seven valleys of the ancient
confederation of the Lavedan. It is not a valley at all, any
more than is that of S. Savin, which formed another, both
being mountain slopes, one on the right, the other on the left
bank of the Gave. This was the Devantaïgue, which means
literally, “in face of the waters,” and comprised five communes.
In it is the Castle of Beaucens, the former residence of the
counts of Lavedan, before it passed into the hands of the
King of Navarre. It is an imposing ruin, with the little
village clustered about the feet of the rock on which it stands.
Tradition is, as we were informed by the peasants, that up
to the Revolution a terrible toll was exacted of this little
commune; it was bound annually to supply a girl to become
a prostitute in Paris.</p>

<p>The Valley of Azun, next to that of Barèges, is the largest
of the seven of the confederacy. It is cut off from the basin
of Argelez by a barrier of rock, through which its steel-blue
Gave has sawn a way. The road to reach the valley has to
mount high to surmount the barrier; and this point was
strongly defended by three fortresses, the most considerable
of which was Castelnau-d’Azun. The ruins are dominated
by a donjon and a square tower, of the fourteenth century,
which castle was held by the English till taken by assault by
the peasants in 1404. Above the ravine cleft by the river
is a rock from which the inhabitants hurled a collector of
taxes into the abyss, a simpler proceeding than paying
their dues. But they were always an independent people,
self-governing, almost autonomous. Every householder,
female as well as male, voted to elect their consuls and representative
at the common parliament that sat at Argelez,
comprising those sent from each of the seven valleys to regulate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
such matters as concerned all conjointly. One can understand
how restive they were under the English tyranny.
The kings of Navarre respected the privileges of the confederate
little republics, and did not interfere with them,
but sent a bailiff to administer justice in his name.</p>

<p>The Valley of Azun had to be watched and well guarded,
as down it came one of the passages from Spain over a col.
Accordingly, the castles on the barrier were but one link
in the defence. Arras, farther up, had two more castles,
now degraded to prosaic use. Above Arras again is Aucun.
The church contains two <i>bénitiers</i>, one, richly carved, represents
a wedding, with tumblers, and a musician playing
the bagpipes. The other, also of white marble, has on it
rudely-sculptured bears in various postures. Aucun was the
capital of this miniature republic. A little below it a road
descends to and crosses the Gave, and then mounting to the
village of Bun leads up the narrow valley of the Gave de
Lebat to the pretty bottle-green lakelet of Estaing lying at
the foot of the Soum de Monné, behind which is Cauterets.</p>

<p>Farther up the valley of Azun is Arreins, whence started
the track leading into Spain by the Col de la Peyre S. Martin.
The church served as a refuge in time of danger. It still
keeps its crenellated wall of enclosure.</p>

<p>Hard by is the pilgrimage chapel of Puy-al-Hun, on a rock
standing boldly up out of the midst of the valley. A writer
in 1837 thus describes <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We went up to Notre Dame Pouey-la-Unt, beautifully
set down upon a platform overlooking a world of sweet and
serene aspect, and having for its rough pavement the rock on
which it is built. A fissure runs through it, and when it rains,
a stream through the fissure; but the walls are panelled
brown and gold, the roof is azure starred with gold, the pillars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the high altar twisted like those of the baldaquin of S.
Peter’s at Rome, gorgeously gilt and gracefully wreathed with
vine leaves and tendrils and bunches of grapes, all gold or its
likeness.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The chapel is much the same now as it was when this was
written, but the stream no longer flows in the channel athwart
the floor. The Commissioners of the Directory visited the
place to plunder the shrine and destroy the image of the
Virgin, but when they entered the church they were scared
by unearthly noises proceeding from above, and they ran
away. These noises were produced by some young peasants
who had secreted themselves between the vaulting and the
roof. However, the chapel was sold, and bought by a farmer’s
widow in the place. Next a small garrison was quartered in
it, for the protection of the frontier against the Spaniards,
and the impression of their muskets on the balustrades may
still be seen. One evening the women of Arreins, disguising
themselves as Spanish soldiers, to the roll of drum, in the
dusk made an attack on the chapel, and the garrison, thinking
discretion the better part of valour, decamped, and did not
halt to take breath till they reached Argelez.</p>

<p>The chapel was visited by Queen Hortense in 1807; she
had recently lost her son, the Prince Royal of Holland, and
she founded here a Mass to be said in perpetuity for the
repose of his soul. The Abbé Pome, then owner and chaplain
of the sanctuary, wrote to give the Queen an account of the
first anniversary Mass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That day, which should have been one of mourning by
recalling the memory of a prince born to be the successor of
the great Napoleon, has become a day of joy and thankfulness
through the birth of another prince, who, generated in our
mountains, and, if I may presume to say so, under the special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
protection of the Virgin, has dried up all our tears, has reanimated
our courage, and has become the object of our most
flattering hopes.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This prince just born was Louis Napoleon, who became
Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>In 1870 Mr. Lawlor published his <i>Pilgrimages in the Pyrenees</i>,
and in it says of Napoleon <span class="locked">III:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The protection of Our Lady of Poëy-la-hun would seem
never to have deserted him through all his adventures and
dangers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>An unhappy sentence written shortly before the disaster
of Sedan in 1871.</p>

<p>On a beautifully wooded height on the right as ascending
the Valley of Argelez are seen the tower and church and buildings
of S. Savin, where was an abbey of great importance,
but of which now all that remain are the church and the chapter-house.
The abbot was Seigneur over the so-called Valley
of S. Savin, and that of Cauterets, then desert and poor, which
belonged to the confraternity. But although seigneur, the
abbot was by no means a despotic lord. The little republic
of S. Savin would not admit him into his monastery, let him
even cross the bounds of the “valley” till he had taken oath
to respect the ancient rights and liberties of the place. Its
electors went by the name of <i>voisins</i>; but the abbot alone
represented S. Savin in the Estates of Bigorre, and he
presided over the deliberations of the assembly of <i>voisins</i>
and <i>voisines</i>, for women as well as men were the representatives
of the will and rights of the little republic, and a single veto
would suffice to prevent the execution of any measure voted.
On one occasion a <i>voisine</i>, named Galhardine de Fréchon,
opposed her veto to the rest of the assembly which was otherwise
unanimous, and thus paralyzed their action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
The abbot and his monks doubtless lived well: hunted,
and lounged and slept in their comfortable quarters, without
discharging their religious duties other than in a perfunctory
manner, for the Chevalier Bestin, in his verses relative to
a stay in the Pyrenees, boasted <span class="locked">of&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Le long dîner, la courte messe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Du bon abbé de Saint Savin.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The abbey occupies, it is believed, the site of the Palatium
Æmilianum, which served as a retreat for Savinus, son of a
Count of Barcelona, and nephew of the Count of Poitiers, in
the eighth century. The abbey was erected by Charlemagne,
and here, so goes the legend, Roland fought and cleft from
head to waist two Saracen giants, and constrained a third to
submit to baptism. In 843 the terrible Northmen destroyed
the monastery. Raymond I, Count of Bigorre, rebuilt it
in 945; and he it was who granted the Valley of Cauterets
to the monastery. It also possessed sole rights to the interment
of the inhabitants of the Val d’Azun. When, on one
occasion, these people ventured to bury one of their dead
near the church of Arreins, the monks forced them to dig up
the body, although in an advanced state of putrefaction,
and transport it to S. Savin. It is probably in reference to
this that Frossard, a Protestant pastor, and one of the first
writers on the Pyrenees, says that the monks enjoyed “several
privileges at once destructive to individual liberty and to
sound morals.”</p>

<p>The first appearance of S. Savin is eminently striking;
the massive walls, the large rude blocks of which they are
constructed, the lofty apse, the fine portal, and even the
clumsy fifteenth-century tower, with its ill-shaped spire,
are all impressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
The present church is of the beginning of the twelfth
century, and the architecture is of the plainest and most
severe Romanesque. On the tympanum of the west door
is a figure of Christ between the evangelistic symbols, but so
weathered as to be scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>In the interior is the marble tomb of S. Savin; far more
ancient than the present church, it is a rude, early sarcophagus.
But what is of special interest are the two large
paintings on wood, each in nine compartments, representing
the legend of the saint, the inscriptions under each group are
in patois. In the sacristy are preserved the hood and comb
of Savin.</p>

<p>A “bénétier des cagots” is a holy water vessel, near the
entrance, supported by figures, supposed to represent members
of the proscribed race. The organ case is of 1557, and is
adorned with three faces that loll their tongues and roll their
eyes, hardly to the edification of the congregation, when the
bellows are worked.</p>

<p>The village itself of S. Savin is small, silent, and deserted,
and impresses one with a sense of melancholy. But the great
beauty of S. Savin is the view one enjoys from it, especially
from the chapel of the Pietà, of the upper portion of the basin
of the Valley of Argelez. Villages and hamlets are strewn
thick over it and on the mountain side opposite. One can
see up the Valley of Isaby to the ruin of Saint Orens, and the
Pic de Viscos towering as a pyramid above Pierrefite, where
open the gorges of the Gave from Luz and from Cauterets.</p>

<p>A scramble up the Valley of Isaby to S. Orens will repay
the trouble.</p>

<p>Orens was born at Huescar, in the marches of Aragon.
He sold his estate and retired as a hermit to the Valley of
Lavedan. He was elected Bishop of Auch about 419, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
was dispatched as ambassador from Theodoric the Ostrogoth
to sue for peace from Aetius, the Roman general, and was
successful. He was the author of a religious poem, the
“Commonitorium,” still extant, and died in 439 at his
monastery in the Lavedan, to which he had retired at an
advanced age from his see.</p>

<p>This monastery had fallen into bad ways in the eighteenth
century, and the repute of the monks was so evil that the
Bishop of Tarbes visited it in 1738. The prior took to his
heels when he heard that an investigation into his malpractices
was to be held. At the time the entire community
was reduced to prior, sacristan, and a single monk, and these
no longer resided in the monastery, but lodged with the <i>curé</i>
of Villelongue. In the <i>procès</i> instituted against the convent
we <span class="locked">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One of the three above-mentioned is the craftiest and most
dangerous man conceivable. He is the cock of the village.
He attempted to murder the prior. He stole one of the chalices.
The other monk is the most imbecile and stupid creature in
the place. He has lived on in the house for the last fifty years,
and does not know how to read.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The ruins of the church stand boldly above the torrent
that descends in a series of cascades. The stream may be
followed up to the Lake of Isaby, from which it rises.</p>

<p>The basin of Argelez comes abruptly to an end at Pierrefite,
surmounted by a ruined castle; here the Pic de Viscos
divides, with the chain running from it, the valleys of Luz and
of Cauterets; the Gaves from these break out of the cleft
rock, for that is what Pierrefite means, on one side and on the
other, and here unite. At this point terminates the railway;
but hence electric trams ply to Cauterets up one ravine, and
to Luz up the other.</p>

<p>The line to Cauterez rises rapidly up steep inclines and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
describing curves that command views down the chasm
where the Gave boils and thunders. A tunnel is entered,
passed through, and the view back of the sun-bathed, fertile
Valley of Argelez, of the walnuts and chestnuts of S. Savin,
is excluded. We have passed from one world into another;
from golden sunlight into mountain gloom, from one vegetation
to another as well. The rocks add to the effect of
transition, for they are of dark schist streaked with ferruginous
stains, and there are long spreading refuse slides from
the lead mines of Pierrefite, too poisonous to allow any shrub,
even grass, to grow on them. There are no gaps up which the
eye can look to gleaming snow fields, till all at once we emerge
on the basin of Cauterets, where the mountains fall back
and open and show us the sunlit snow, and a river dancing
down in a fine fall, and before us a bit of Paris dropped out of
the clouds into this solitude.</p>

<p>But Cauterets and Luz must be reserved for another
chapter.</p>

<p>I cannot quit the radiant Valley of Argelez without a
kindly tribute to the simple, warm-hearted peasantry. As
I have already said, we spent a summer in a château on the
mountain side, high up opposite Argelez. My mother visited
the poor cottagers, and where there was sickness did what
every English lady would do, sent relief, and did better
than that, showed tender sympathy. When we left, in the
autumn, to return for the winter to Pau, our carriage was
surrounded by the poor people, bringing their humble offerings
of stewed pears, grapes, figs, apples, cakes, and we were
laden with their gifts, more than we could consume, but were
unable to refuse; and what was better still, as we whirled
away, were attended by their best wishes, and not a few
sincere regrets and tears.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> an early period Cauterets enjoyed great repute.
By a charter of 945 Raymond I, Count of Bigorre,
granted the valley to the abbey of S. Savin, on condition
that they built there a church in honour of S. Martin, and that
they maintained at the hot springs a hospital for the patients
who visited them.</p>

<p>Of these springs there are two groups. The upper, La
Raillère, is at some distance from the town, but is reached
by electric tram. It takes its name from the avalanches
(raillères) that have made their pathway down the mountain
side above it, and have left their white and ghastly scars on
the rocks, and heaped wreckage below. This is the most
abundant group of springs, but the space there is narrow,
and lies in a gorge. The thermal establishment has to be
maintained on huge walled terraces. There is no hotel there;
but those who use the waters for baths or for gargling come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
and go by the tram. The platform on which the baths of
La Raillère are constituted command a view of the deep valley
of Lutour, down which descends a stream issuing from a
chain of little lakes lying in the lap of the Pic de Mallerouge,
9740 feet, the lowest of which, the Lac d’Estom, discharges
its waters by a beautiful cascade, and they further
leap down into the basin of Cauterets at its extremity in a
white streak. Above the Lac d’Estom in a wild chaotic cirque
are the tarns that feed it; one of these retains its coat of ice
almost all the year through.</p>

<p>The Lutour joins the Gave de Jerret above La Raillère,
and it is up this latter that the way leads to the Pont d’Espagne
and the Lac de Gaube, about which more presently.
Another Gave, that of Cambasque, unites with the Gave of
Pierrefite by the station of the electric tram at Cauterets,
and below the town itself.</p>

<p>The Thermes des Œufs, so designated from the smell of
rotten eggs, sulphuretted hydrogen, emitted by the waters,
is one of the most luxuriously furnished establishments of
the kind in Europe. Six springs contribute their water to
the baths. Above these is the casino.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Cauterets,” said Taine, “is a bourg at the bottom of a
valley, dismal enough, paved, and furnished with an <i>octroi</i>.
Innkeepers, guides, all that ravenous population surround us.
We are annexed by touts, children, donkey-drivers, by the
first <i>garçons</i> who can hitch on to us. We are handed cards,
we receive recommendations to this hotel for its situation,
to that for its cuisine. We are attended, cap in hand, by the
crowd, elbowing one another out of the way, to the end of the
village. ‘This is my traveller,’ shouts one, ‘come near him
and I will horsewhip you.’ Every hotel has its herd of touts.
Here all are hunters. In winter they hunt the chamois, in
summer the tourist.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Cauterets has been considerably enlarged and improved
since the above was written, but the tout is ever with you.
Something like ten thousand persons visit Cauterets during
the season to drink the waters or to bathe in them. But in
fact it has a double <i>clientèle</i>, one of patients and the other of
excursionists. The former move like clockwork to the baths
and back again, like a long black revolving chain; then
to their hotels or lodging-houses, to their meals, to their
promenade, to their beds; and throughout the day thus
mechanically passed, the tick-tack of their talk, always
about their symptoms and their sufferings, their progress
or their relapses, is maintained without cessation. But the
second class of visitors are such as desire to climb the Vignemale,
to ascend to the highest tarns above Estom; at the least
to see the Lac de Gaube. These pertain to an order of beings
very distinct from the patients. They have no aches and
pains. They turn away their noses from the savour of the
springs. They are quivering with energy, muscular, and
restless. They look upon the patients with undisguised
contempt, and the latter scowl at those who enjoy rude
health with querulous dissatisfaction. There is yet another
category of visitors&mdash;the pilgrims to Lourdes; they arrive
fagged with their devotions and overstrained emotions, to
relax, laugh, and perhaps entertain some incredulity as to
the marvels of the Grotto of Massabielle. The market at
Cauterets is gay with stalls during the season, that lasts from
1 June to the end of September; every trifle is to be found
in them, from gay-coloured Merino shawls, rock-crystals, toys,
rosaries, sacred images to picture cards.</p>

<p>The Pont d’Espagne, that can be reached by a carriage,
and the Lac de Gaube, are points omitted by no excursionist
who visits Cauterets. The former is a stone bridge thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
over the river formed by the junction of the Gave de Mascadou
and that which issues from the Lac de Gaube. Higher
up the first of these is a picturesque wooden bridge thrown
across the torrent.</p>

<p>The path to the Lac de Gaube leaves the road just before
reaching the Pont d’Espagne. The lake is a lovely mountain
tarn two miles and a half in circumference. The sides are
steep, in places clothed with dark masses of pines; and in
the background rises the Vignemale, 10,820 feet, with its
crevassed glacier, that feeds the lake by a cascade.</p>

<p>By the water is a white marble monument to the memory
of a Mr. Pattison and his wife, who were drowned here whilst
on their wedding trip, within a month of their marriage, on
20 September, 1832. Mrs. Ellis thus describes the accident.
Her husband was acquainted with the relatives of <span class="locked">both:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is said to have been a bright and beautiful morning
when the English bride and bridegroom went out upon this
lake, in the fisherman’s rudely-constructed boat, the very
same that we saw lying by the shore, than which a more unsafe
or unmanageable vessel could scarcely be imagined. Little
seems to be known of the awful event which followed, except
what those who stood on the shore relate, that when the boat was
about the middle of the lake, the figure of the man was seen
stooping overboard&mdash;that the female, alarmed for his safety,
rushed to the same side&mdash;and thus, the vessel being overbalanced,
both were plunged into a watery grave. The bodies
were both found, though one not till a month after. They were
conveyed to England, and buried at Witham, in Essex.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The recklessness of the villagers in times past had threatened
Cauterets with destruction. The forests had been cut
down, and free course given to the avalanches to fall into the
valley and cover all with stones and mud. If something had
not been effected to bridle the torrent above La Raillère, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
springs there would have been overwhelmed with rubble,
and the thermal establishment utterly wrecked. The ravine
down which the avalanches fall is that of Péquère, and it
was not snow and small stuff only that was brought down,
but huge masses of rock.</p>

<p>Great pains have been taken, by means of replanting the
slopes and the erection of barriers, to protect the baths, and
these efforts have been happily crowned with success. Since
1897 another avalanche path has been taken in hand,
that of the Lizey, which menaced the road to Pierrefite,
and had in fact cut all communication during three weeks
in 1895.</p>

<p>Even the esplanade of Cauterets was threatened. The
winter of 1903&ndash;4 tried the place severely; in the month of
January the masses of fallen snow reached the town itself.
In spite of themselves the inhabitants of the basin have had
to yield to the resolution of the Board of Forestry and allow
extensive replantation.</p>

<p>The journey up the ravine to Luz by electric tram presents
a succession of beautiful peeps of the bottle-green river
thundering through the gorge, breaking into masses of foam
at every leap; waterfalls descend the mountain sides right
and left&mdash;everywhere is rich and luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>The gorge opens to reveal the green meadows of Viscos,
then contracts again, once more to expand into the basin
of Luz. High aloft on a terrace stand the villages of Vizos
and Esquièze, with their church spires. In the background
is seen a superb circle of snow-clad mountains, those of the
ridge of the Mont Perdu, nearer the Soum Blanc on one side
and the Pic Long on the other.</p>

<p>The whole of the district, from the opening of the gorge
at Pierrefite upwards, formed the Pays or Val de Barèges,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
which formerly enjoyed to a high degree the rights of self-government.
It was practically an independent republic
till the time of the Revolution, its liberties accorded to it
in acknowledgment of services rendered in wars with Spain.
Few taxes were imposed; that most severely felt elsewhere,
on salt, did not trouble the Barègois. They had entire liberty
to chase and to fish, rights so jealously reserved by the princes
elsewhere. Even in diplomacy Barèges preserved a sort of
autonomy, and treated with delegates from the Spanish
valleys without reference to the counts of Bigorre or the
kings of France.</p>

<p>What strikes the eye at once on arriving at Luz is the old
Castle of Sainte Marie, now reduced to a ruin, perched on a
height; and the curious parish church, built and fortified by
the Templars, who had a commandery here. The crenellated
walls now enclosing the small area in which stands the church
were built by the Knights of Malta, who succeeded to the
place that had been occupied by the Templars, after the
suppression of this latter order.</p>

<p>On each side of the apse is a tower, one of which resembles
the keep of a castle. The ramparts surrounding the old
cemetery of the Knights are passed through an embattled
gateway.</p>

<p>There are two portals into the church, that on the north
being the main entrance, and it is Romanesque. The tympanum,
surrounded by inscriptions of the twelfth century,
contains symbols of the evangelists surrounding a figure of
Christ. The bases of the columns of the doorway also bear
inscriptions. The interior of the church is dark, dungeon-like,
and the decorations and furniture are barbaric. On
the south side of the nave is a late chapel dedicated to S. Mary
Magdalen. A child’s stone sarcophagus serves as a <i>bénitier</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
at the entrance to the church. Here, as at S. Savin, is a
Cagot’s door.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the best preserved Templar church in
France. So far it has not undergone restoration, but it is
far too small for a growing place, and a new church will have
to be built elsewhere.</p>

<p>Above Luz, on a height, is a hermitage, formerly occupied
by a Père Ambrose, who died in the odour of sanctity in
1778. He was a Capuchin friar, born in 1708, who had
embraced the religious life at the age of sixteen. He wrote
some godly works, one on the Joy of the Soul, one on the
Peace of the Soul, and a third consisted of letters giving
spiritual advice.</p>

<p>The chapel is dedicated to S. Peter. Napoleon III had it
rebuilt, and entitled S. Pierre-de-Solférino. Near by is a
cairn, under which lie the bones of Ambrose, the last hermit
to occupy the place. The ruins of the Castle of S. Marie date
from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There are two
keeps. This fortress was formerly the principal stronghold
commanding the Valley of Barèges. It was built by the
English originally, and held by them, terrorizing the inhabitants
of the basin, till the Barègois peasants rose in a body
against them in 1404, stormed the castle, and put the garrison
to the sword. After that it was rebuilt and strengthened.</p>

<p>Saint Sauveur consists of a long street of hotels, and is
occupied in the summer alone. In winter and spring every
door and window is barred. It is reached from Luz over a
bridge, erected in 1860 by order of Napoleon III. The keystone
of the arch is 198 feet above the torrent.</p>

<div id="if_p169" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p169.jpg" width="600" height="453" alt="" /><div class="caption">LA BRÊCHE DE ROLAND</div></div>

<p>Another bridge, farther up, is that of Scia; like the former,
constructed of white marble, and thrown at an amazing height
above the Gave, where huge blocks of granite intercept its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
course, and it roars and tumbles savagely over the obstruction.
A French guide-book asserts that at the spot an
English lady, the Lady Clara, standing on the bridge, recited
the celebrated soliloquy of Hamlet, in this fashion: “To
die, to slip!” and then flung herself into the abyss. No such
an incident ever occurred there.</p>

<p>The Brêche de Roland, a gash in the high ridge of snow
and rock above Gavarnie, now becomes visible, as Pragnères
is reached, but it is invisible from Gavarnie itself.</p>

<p>The story goes that Roland hacked this opening in the
rock with his sword Durandal in the hopes of breaking the
blade, so that the Saracens might not get possession of it at
his death. But the tale has been transferred hither from
Roncevaux. It is certainly curious to note how that legends
of Roland have attached themselves to numerous places in
the Pyrenees from west to east. He occupies there the place
that King Arthur does in England, Scotland, and Wales.
We have seen how that at S. Savin he was said to have fought
with giants. Now it is a curious fact that according to tradition
Vizos, near Luz, was occupied by a race of giants called
Empresous, <i>les Preux</i>, and that representatives of them
remained on there till the end of the eighteenth century.
The Revolution seems to have cut them down, for we hear of
no others since then. In the Archives of Luz is a record of
the death of an Empresou named Barèque, in 1771, at the
age of a hundred and ten. These giants had a cemetery of
their own, and a baptistery of their own. They seem to have
been regarded with something like the repulsion with which
the Cagots were considered. In the churchyard have been
turned up human bones of extraordinary size.</p>

<p>The valley or gorge of the Gave has been much belauded
and often described. This naturally has produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
a revulsion. M. Ardouin-Dumazet has led the way. He
<span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The road is fine, without exactly deserving all the hyperbolical
praises lavished upon it. That which is the spoiling
of this country is the extravagance of the admiration expressed
for it. Since the time of Ramond no one who speaks of the
Pyrenees can describe a site without declaring it to be incomparable.
If they have judged it incomparable, it is because
they have seen nothing with which to compare it. The panorama
from Pau, truly marvellous, I admit, is not superior to
that of the Alps, the Jura, and the Cevennes, seen from the
hills above Lyons on a clear day. It is so with this country.
I do not venture to use the expression Gasconading with reference
to these descriptions, but I cannot pitch my note at the
diapason of the Pyrenean infatuists.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This may be true enough of the way to Gavarnie, but I
do venture to believe that the Cirque of Gavarnie&mdash;the end
of this expedition up the Gave&mdash;is, <i>pace</i> Ardouin-Dumazet,
incomparable.</p>

<p>Gèdre was a wretched hamlet some years ago, when I first
knew it, but now it has its hotels, and is a very convenient
tarrying place whence to explore the valley of the Héas, and
visit the two cirques of Estaubé and Troumousse; as also the
valley of the Aspé, descending from the glacier of Mallerouge.</p>

<p>The Héas issues from a narrow fissure, foaming over cascades.
Higher up in the ravine is the chapel of Notre Dame
de Héas, planted on a huge block fallen from the mountain
above. It is held that the Virgin once appeared to a shepherd
at this spot.</p>

<p>This mass is but one portion of a landslip that took place
in 1650, which dammed up the river and formed a lake,
which in its turn was destroyed by a flood in 1788. Among
the fallen rocks may be found the beautiful <i>Saxifraga pyramidalis</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
or <i>longifolia</i>, and the <i>Ramondia pyrenaica</i>. Pilgrimages
are made to the chapel on 15 August and 8 September.</p>

<p>The Cirque de Troumousse is above Héas. It is less remarkable
than that of Gavarnie, though more extensive.
It lacks the series of bold escarpments capped with glacier
that form the distinguishing feature of the latter.</p>

<p>Above Gèdre, on the route to Gavarnie is a <i>chaos</i>, an
agglomeration of fallen gneiss rocks from above; it is as if
half a mountain had been precipitated into the valley from
the Coumélie. Farther up may be seen a cleft rock, between
the jaws of which hangs a mass, arrested there on its way down.
The scenery becomes grander, but at the same time more
dreary; the cirque opens before one, and we reach the village
of Gavarnie.</p>

<p>The Cirque of Gavarnie has been already briefly described
in my first chapter. To see it to advantage it should be
visited in spring or early summer, when, from the melting
of the snows, the great fall is full of water. It resembles the
Staubbach only in the long drop of the stream and its resolution
into fine spray. The setting of it is immeasurably
superior to that of the famous Swiss fall. The height is
1385 feet, and is the highest in Europe, except one or two in
Norway. If there be plenty of water it shoots down in one
single column; but in summer it descends in two leaps.
This is not the only cascade in the cirque; down every part
of the huge curve threads of water drop into the basin. Towards
the end of a hot summer many of these fail, and the
great cascade is much reduced.</p>

<p>The first sight of the cirque is disappointing. There is
nothing by which to scale it, and the appearance is only one
of size, gloom, and cold. The bottom of the great bowl is
heaped with rubble brought down from above. But at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Gavarnie we are four miles from the foot of the cirque, and it
looks as if not more than a quarter of an hour’s stroll was
required to reach it. A thousand feet seems to be no more
than a hundred, and the huge rocks hurled down from above
are reduced in appearance to mere pebbles.</p>

<p>A stone dropped from the top of the Pic du Marboré,
10,600 feet, will fall 5500 feet into the cirque. In the church
of Gavarnie are to be seen twelve skulls, held to have belonged
to the Templars of Luz, who fled hither, and were here
executed. A story is current that on the last night of the year,
just before the clock strikes midnight, a Templar clothed in
white, and with a red cross on his breast, enters the church
at Gavarnie and cries, “Ho! who are there that will stand
up and fight for the temple?” Whereupon one skull after
another replies, “None; the temple is destroyed.” This
white-robed Templar is Du Molay, the Grand Master, burned
alive at Paris, with four other great dignitaries of the Order.
King Philip the Fair coveted the great possessions of the
Knights, and Pope Clement V had obtained the tiara by the
help of the King; the price he paid for it was the dissolution
of the Order, and the sacrifice of the Knights to torture and
death. In the midst of the fire Du Molay cried out, “Clement,
iniquitous and cruel judge, I summon thee within forty days
to meet me before the throne of God.” According to some
accounts he cited the King as well. Du Molay was burnt on
18 March, 1314; on 30 April, Clement was dead; and Philip
the Fair on 29 November, in the same year.</p>

<p>The road over the pass of the Tourmalet branches off below
Luz and ascends the desolate Valley of Bastan, ravaged by
avalanches, to Barèges, a long street of hotels and lodging-houses
closed during the winter. The baths here have been
famous for long. The waters impregnated with sulphate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of soda are the most powerful in the Pyrenees, and are charged
with a peculiar nitrogenous substance called glairine that
renders them oily to the touch. Their great use is for the
healing of wounds and ulcers, and for scrofula. They have
been employed for a military hospital since 1760. Barèges
stands over 5000 feet above the sea, yet it is more bleak
and inhospitable in appearance than many a town such
as Briançon, little short of it in altitude. A covered tank
for bathers was erected here in 1550; and hither, to take
advantage of the waters, came Mme. de Maintenon, in 1677
with the young Duke of Maine.</p>

<p>The scourge of the place has been the avalanches, mainly
those that shoot down by four great paths from the Labas
Blancs, the mountain to the north, and which bring the town
or village, call it which you will, under 100,000 cubic feet of
snow. Extensive works have been undertaken to prevent
the complete destruction of the houses, baths, and hospitals.
Huge barriers of masonry 40 feet high and 46 feet long by
18 feet wide have been drawn across the ravine of Le Theil,
and extensive replanting of the sides with pines has reduced
the danger; but it will take many years of growth before
the trees attain a sufficient height to be able to completely
screen the place. The ravine of Le Theil may be said to
have been already rendered innocuous; but that of Midaou
caused disaster in July, 1897, when an avalanche carried
away a portion of the baths, and choked the valley as far as
to Luz. Since 1900, however, this trough of the avalanche
has been blocked.</p>

<p>On the left bank also the work has been energetically
pursued to arrest the fall of torrents of snow from the Pic
d’Ayré, where the avalanche path is formed of glacial clay,
hard as cement when dry, but in time of rain forming a flood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
of mud falling 1200 feet. Here replanting has proved efficacious,
and barriers of masonry have been erected, that
have served the purpose intended. This work was begun
in 1862, and since 1869 no lava-like flood of mud has reached
the Valley of Bastan. The inspector Dellon <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The regulation of the system of the torrents of Rieulet and
Bayet, the fixing of the glacial mud which constitutes to a
large extent the banks of these torrents, and the foot of the
slope of the mountains facing Barèges, the attenuation of the
avalanches, so dangerous to this thermal station, all prove the
efficacy of the means adopted. The contrast is most striking
between the districts within the range of these torrents acquired
by the State, and such others as have not, and still
belong to the communes. In these latter the devastation increases
every year, annually exposing the <i>route nationale</i> and
the Bastan to ever magnifying dangers of obstruction.”</p></blockquote>

here as elsewhere, the Board of Forestation meets with
sullen and stubborn opposition from the peasantry.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> Tarbes it is possible to escape in four directions,
for from it radiate lines to Paris, to Pau, to Bagnières,
and to Toulouse, and another is in prospect to Rustan and
Mayonac.</p>

<p>No one presumably would stay in Tarbes for two days
unless he were an official tied to duties in it and enjoying
a salary, or were possessed with a passion for horses. For,
indeed, in Tarbes itself there is nothing to be seen save the
Haras and the depot for remounts to the cavalry. The
cathedral is the most cumbrous, ungainly minster in all
France. The public buildings lack interest. One thing
Tarbes does possess, that it shares with the meanest village
in the same arrondisement&mdash;the view of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Inglis, who trudged the Pyrenees in 1830, thus describes
the <span class="locked">prospect:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have read in some book that the most beautiful part of
every country is where the mountains sink down into the plains,
and of this assertion the situation of Tarbes offers an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
illustration. If I had never gone further into the Pyrenees
than Tarbes I might have said that nothing can exceed the
beauty of its neighbourhood. The charming plain that environs
it&mdash;yet not altogether a plain&mdash;stretches to the foot of
the mountains, rich in every production of the southern latitude,
beautifully diversified with wood, and watered by the
meanderings of the Adour and of several lesser streams. The
celebrated Valley of Bagnères opens to the left, that of Lourdes
to the right; while in the south, apparently at but a few leagues
distant, the Pic du Midi towers above the range of mountains
that extend to the right and to the left, as far as the eye can
reach.</p>

<p>“After the long continuation of carriage-travelling from
Avignon to Tarbes&mdash;oh, how I enjoyed this morning! It was
a glorious morning, and the magnificent range of the Pyrenees,
rising sharply from the plain, was bathed in sunbeams, which
gilded the eminences, reposed on the slopes, and gleamed in
among the valleys. If this book should chance to be read by
anyone who knows the scenery of Scotland, let him recollect
the road from Stirling along the foot of the Ochill Hills, and
he will have a better conception of the country through which
I am now conveying him, than could be conveyed by a thousand
minute descriptions. It is true his imagination must assist
me; he must imagine the Ochills seven to eight thousand feet
high in place of two thousand; he must substitute Indian
corn of the most luxuriant growth, for oats and barley; and,
in place of whin-blossoms covering the knolls, he must fancy
them clothed with vine; he must add the charm of a southern
sky, and the balminess of a southern clime.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Tarbes is a huge, straddling city, a great village giving itself
the airs of a capital. On entering it from the station the
town has an unattractive aspect. An avenue has been driven
from the Gave to the Place Maubourguet, which is the centre
of the town; but it has few houses along it, and none of consequence,
and these throughout Tarbes have the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
of villas in a suburb, surrounded with gardens. Some effort
has been made to retrieve the ugliness of the town by the
erection of fountains and statues, and by planting handsome
promenades. But it is a lifeless place, only acquiring animation
on the occasion of its fairs. The river strays in its
vast bed, broken into several streams by rubble banks. It has
been drawn off above the town by numerous channels of irrigation,
so that when it reaches Tarbes it is out of proportion to
its bed, as might be an infant in the vast fourposter of Ware.</p>

<p>But the Jardin Massey is the pride of Tarbes; it is a park extending
over thirty acres&mdash;space is no object in Tarbes&mdash;and is
really interesting. It was the gift to his native town by the
man whose name it bears. Massey left Tarbes as a journeyman
gardener, and visited Holland, where he obtained a
situation as director of the gardens of the king. Louis
Philippe summoned him to France, and made him manager
of the gardens of Versailles. As he had amassed a good deal
of money, he resolved on spending it for the adornment of
his native town. He bought the land where now is the park,
dug a lake, formed water-courses, planted rare trees, laid out
flower-beds and lawns, and built a museum of natural history
commanded by a lofty tower. In fifty years the trees have
grown to a considerable size; and later benefactors have
enriched the gardens with statues, busts, and the museum
with sculptures and paintings. In the park has been erected
the beautiful cloister of the fifteenth century removed from
S. Sever-de-Rustan, a monastery wrecked by the Calvinists,
under Lizier, who massacred all the inhabitants of the town,
with the exception of seven persons. The monks would have
been also put to death but that Queen Jeanne had already
suppressed the abbey, and they had been dispersed. Next
to the Jardin Massey the Haras should be inspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
In ancient days the horses of the county of Bigorre, the
viscounty of Béarn, and of Lower Navarre were highly esteemed;
the race was called Navarrine, and it owed its merits
to the fact that it was a cross between the Arab and the
native Pyrenean stock. The Saracens had crossed the mountains,
overflowed Aquitaine, and threatened Northern France,
they were met at Poitiers and routed by Charles Martel in
731. Three hundred thousand Saracens, say the old chroniclers,
with their usual exaggeration, fell on the field; the rest
fled, the main body to Narbonne, others to such passes as
they knew that led to Saragossa. A battle was fought near
Tarbes, in which the flying remnant was utterly routed
and exterminated. A great number of their stallions and
mares remained in the hands of the victors, and it was from
this capture that sprang the so much coveted and esteemed
race of the Navarrine horse.</p>

<p>By degrees the quality declined and degenerated, reverting
to the type of the Basque horse. This was due partly to
lack of importation of fresh Arab blood, and partly to the
mountaineers neglecting the breeding of horses for that of
mules, specially serviceable to them among the mountain
passes where were tracks, but no roads. The evil became
so great that the Estates of Bigorre voted two thousand
livres annually for the maintenance of stallions. During the
Revolution, when there was great demand for mounts for
the cavalry, the scarcity of good horses attracted the attention
of the Council of Five Hundred. Napoleon took the matter
in hand with his characteristic energy. In 1806 he founded
the Haras at Tarbes, and the introduction of English blood
was the basis of the transformation attempted. Later,
during the campaigns in Algeria, the finest stallions taken
from the Arabs were sent to Tarbes; and the result has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the production of a horse admirably adapted to the use of
light cavalry, that goes now by the name of the Tarbes horse.
Mm. Simonoff and Mörder, of the Russian haras, thus speak
of <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The three bloods of which the Tarbes horse derives&mdash;the
Arab, the English, and the old Navarrin&mdash;are so near to each
other, being all of Oriental origin, that the fusion took place
easily and quickly; and although as yet the Tarbes horses are
not of perfect homogeneity, it is quite possible to speak of
them as forming a race which by its qualities, is rather full
blood; than half blood.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The stallions are in the Haras at Tarbes, but the mares are
dispersed within a radius of twenty kilometres around Tarbes;
and the rearing of colts is the industry, and makes the fortune
of the department, at all events of the plain and fertile
valleys. Within the district where they are reared there is
not a village, not a farm, that has not its mares for breeding.
Even <i>curés</i> supplement their scanty incomes by keeping
them, and rearing from them. One, the Abbé Turon, sold
to the State his stallion Mousquetaire for 20,000 francs.
This roused a great outcry among the Radicals, who denounced
the Government for having bought from a priest. Tarbes
is the old capital of Bigorre, and here resided the Count.
I have already mentioned Centule I of Béarn, assassinated
in 1088, who put away his wife with the approval of Pope
Gregory VII, so as to marry the heiress of Bigorre. By this
union Bigorre and Béarn were not united, for his son Gaston
by the repudiated Gisela became Viscount of Béarn, and his
son Bernard III inherited Bigorre. This Bernard left issue,
a daughter only, named Beatrice, who married Peter, Viscount
de Marsan, by whom she had Centule III, and he also
left an heiress, Stephanie, married to Bertrand, Count<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of Cominges, by whom she had one child, a daughter
Petronilla.</p>

<p>The story of the annexation of Bigorre to Foix and Béarn
is complicated through the matrimonial vagaries of this
same Petronilla. And this was further complicated by the
action of a pious ancestor, Count Bernard II, who in a fit of
maudlin devotion placed his territory and family under the
protection of the black doll, Notre Dame du Puy, promising
in return for this protection that the county should annually
pay tribute to the church of Le Puy. Certainly Our Lady
of Puy treated Bigorre scurvily in return, allowing the inheritance
to slip through heiresses, five in all, and, moreover,
to involve it in a lawsuit that lasted a hundred and thirty-nine
years.</p>

<p>Petronilla married Gaston, Viscount of Béarn, and when
he died without issue, in 1215, took as number two Nûnez de
Cerdagne, but tired of him speedily, got the marriage annulled,
on the convenient plea of consanguinity, and married in
1216 Guy, son of Simon de Montfort. This was sharp work&mdash;three
husbands in a twelvemonth. By Guy she had two
daughters, Alix and Perette. In 1228 she took a fourth
husband, Aimart de Rançon, and on his death, in the same
year, she espoused her fifth, Boso de Mastas, to whom she
bore a daughter, Martha. By her will Petronilla constituted
Esquirat, eldest son of her daughter Alix, heir to her estates
and titles; but in default of male issue the succession was to
go to Jordan, the second son of Alix. Should he fail to have
a son, then the second substitution was in favour of Martha,
her daughter by Boso, who was married to Gaston VII of
Béarn. Esquirat did have a son, also named Esquirat, but
this second Esquirat died childless, and bequeathed the
county of Bigorre to his sister Lore, as his uncle Jordan had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
died without issue. Now Petronilla and her third husband
Guy de Montfort had left a second daughter, Perette, married
to Raoul de Teisson, and had by him a son William de Teisson,
who conceived that he had a right to the inheritance. Martha,
wife of Gaston de Béarn, had a daughter Constance, and she
also put in a claim. In fact, these were the claimants: Lore,
Viscountess de Turenne; Constance, Viscountess de Béarn;
William de Teisson; and Mahut, daughter of Alix and
Raoul de Courtenay. But that was not all. The younger
Esquirat had made over his inheritance to Simon de Montfort
by a first will, and then, offended at the grasping nature of
Simon, had revoked his will and constituted Lore his heiress.
But Simon refused to recognize the legality of this second
will, sold the viscounty to Thibalt II, King of Navarre, whose
son Henry gave his claim to it to Jeanne, his daughter,
married to Philip the Fair, King of France, and he was but
too ready to acquire this rich district of Gascony on any plea,
bad or good. The church of Le Puy also put in a claim, so
did the King of England as overlord. Consequently there
were from eight to nine claimants.</p>

<p>By decree of Parliament, in 1290, the rights of the church
of Le Puy to the charge on the viscounty were confirmed.</p>

<p>Constance, Viscountess of Béarn, occupied Bigorre with her
troops, and assumed the title of Countess of Bigorre. Jeanne
of France, however, expelled her, adopted the title, and Philip
the Fair asserted his right to the territory, and was prepared
to maintain it by force of arms. Philip had already bought
off the rights of the church of Le Puy. Bigorre remained
under the crown of France till Charles VIII in 1425 granted
it to John, Count of Foix, in return for his services against the
English, and in consideration of his descent from Petronilla.</p>

<p>From 1425 to 1566 the county of Bigorre was wisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
administered by the viscounts of Béarn, who had become
titular Kings of Navarre.</p>

<p>Tarbes was fortified in the tenth century by Raymond I.
It suffered destruction at the hands of the English in 1350
and 1406. But its greatest disasters took place during the
Wars of Religion. Jeanne d’Albret was resolved on forcing
the Reform on the Bigorriens, but they ejected the Huguenot
pastors as fast as they were sent to them, and appealed to the
King of France, who sent troops in 1569 to their aid. Jeanne
enlisted the services of Montgomery. He swept through
the country, ravaging it with fire and sword. He sent his
lieutenant, Montamat, to take Tarbes, and Montamat appeared
under its walls on 20 January, 1570. The besieged,
finding it impossible to hold out, evacuated the city during
the night. When the Huguenots entered they found no one in
the place, and they pillaged the houses and set them on fire.</p>

<p>When he was gone the inhabitants returned and began
to restore their wrecked and gutted houses and to repair
the walls. Montamat reappeared, bringing cannons with
him. François de Bennasse, commandant of the garrison
at Lourdes, had hastened to the defence of the capital
at the head of 800 men. Montamat attempted an assault,
and was repulsed. But a traitor in the town opened the
gates to the Calvinists, and the captain entered. Bennasse,
all his soldiers, and many of the citizens were put to the sword.
The number massacred was so great that it took eight days to
bury them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This took place,” says a contemporary writer, “about the
feast of Easter, in the year 1570. After that the city of Tarbes
remained without inhabitants, and the grass grew in the streets
as in a field, a piteous sight to behold. And three whole years
elapsed without there being a garrison in it; but indeed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
town was incapable of defence on account of the ruins made
by the cannon.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Peace was concluded at S. Germain-en-Laye on 15 May,
1570, and it was hoped that tranquillity would ensue. But
this was not to be. Passions had been wrought to frenzy,
and the thirst for revenge was consuming. The death of
Jeanne d’Albret in 1579 did not allay the troubles. In 1592
the town became the prey of the Leaguers of Cominges, and
from it they issued to devastate the surrounding country,
till expelled in 1594. Almost the whole population of
Cominges had embraced the cause of the League. “There
was never before seen such disorder, such pillage, from the
beginning of these wars. Captains, soldiers, valets, and
volunteers were so laden with furniture that they were
carrying off that they complained it was a trouble to them
to be encumbered with so much spoil. Moreover, in despair,
the peasants of Bigorre abandoned the cultivation of the land,
and many migrated into Spain.”</p>

<p>In 1594 the people themselves rose, and, assisted by
Caumont de la Force, delivered themselves from both Leaguers
and Protestants, and peace was celebrated at Tarbes.</p>

<p>On 12 March, 1814, a combat took place between the English
and Portuguese under Wellington, and the French
under Soult. After the defeat of Orthez Soult had withdrawn
his dispirited soldiers along both banks of the Adour,
steadily pursued by Wellington.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A light division,” says Allison, “and hussars were on the
right bank of the Adour; but when they approached the town,
a simultaneous movement was made by Hill with the right
wing, and Clinton on the left, to envelope and cut off Harispe
and Villatte’s divisions, which formed the French rearguard
in occupation of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
“The combat began at twelve o’clock by a violent fire from
Hill’s artillery on the right, which was immediately re-echoed
in still louder tones by Clinton on the left; while Alton, with
the light division, assailed the centre. The French fought
stoutly, and, mistaking the British rifle battalions, from their
dark uniforms, to be Portuguese, let them come up to the very
muzzles of their guns. But the rifles were hardy veterans,
inured to victory; and at length Harispe’s men, unable to
stand their deadly point-blank fire, broke and fled. If Clinton’s
men on the left had been up at this moment, the French
would have been totally destroyed; for Hill had, at the same
moment, driven back Villate on the right, and the plain beyond
Tarbes was covered with a confused mass of fugitives, closely
followed by the shouting of victorious British. But Clinton’s
troops, notwithstanding the utmost efforts, had not been able
to get up; the numerous ditches and hedges which intersected
the plain rendered all pursuit impossible; and thus the
French, though utterly broken, succeeded with very little loss
in reaching a ridge, three miles distant, when Clauzel, who,
with four divisions, was drawn up to receive them, immediately
opened fire from all his batteries upon the allies.”</p></blockquote>

<p>During the night Soult retired in two columns, and such
was the rapidity of his retreat that he reached Toulouse in
four days.</p>

<p>A native of Tarbes, of whom the town has no occasion to
boast, was Bertrand Barrère, born 10 September, 1755. He
was educated for the Bar at Toulouse, and became a scrivener
at Toul. As his father owned a pretty estate at Vieuzac, in
the Valley of Argelez, he called himself Barrère de Vieuzac,
flattering himself that by this feudal addition to his name
he might pass for a gentleman. He was sent as deputy for
Bigorre to the States-General. Being totally devoid of principle,
when the result of a parliamentary struggle could not
be foreseen he took the precaution of having in his pocket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
two speeches, written in opposed senses, so that he could
always jump in the direction taken by the cat. Barrère had
affected the moderate principles of the Girondists, till he saw
that the extremists were the strongest, and then he threw in
his lot with the Mountain, and voted for the execution of
the King. Then seeing that the current ran strong against
the Girondists, he took the foremost place in procuring the
condemnation to the scaffold of those with whom he had
previously acted in concert. He it was who was set up in the
convention to call for the blood of the Queen. On the day
on which Marie Antoinette was dragged to execution Barrère
regaled Robespierre and other Jacobins at a tavern.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the intervals between the Beaume and the Champagne,
between the ragout of thrushes and the partridges with truffles,
he fervently preached his new political creed. ‘The vessel of
the Revolution,’ he said, ‘can float into port only on waves of
blood. We must begin with the members of the National
Assembly and of the Legislative Assembly. That rubbish
must be swept away.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Reign of Terror began. The Jacobins had prevailed
all along the line. The Convention was reduced to silence.
The sovereignty had passed to the Committee of Public
Safety. Six persons held the chief power in the small cabinet
which domineered over France: Robespierre, Saint Just,
Couthon, Collot, Billaud, and Barrère who had hastily
divested himself of his territorial appendix of De Vieuzac.
Of the horrors of those days it is unnecessary to speak. As
guilty as Robespierre or Couthon was the bland, timorous,
unscrupulous Barrère. He it was who proposed the burning
of the towns and villages of the Vendéeans, the total destruction
of Lyons, the violation of the royal graves at S. Denys,
the deportation of all such as could not bring irrecusable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
proof of patriotism since 1792. He became the declared
adversary of Danton when he found it safe to take that part,
and proposed his arrest on the 9th Thermidor. He contributed
powerfully to the fall of Robespierre; but he had made so
many enemies, was so little trusted, that instead of rising
higher by the fall of Robespierre, he found himself unable
to maintain his balance. He was denounced before the
revolutionary tribunal, along with Collot d’Herbois and
Billaud-Varennes, and was sentenced to be deported to the
pestilential swamps of Cayenne, but obtained the change
of his destination to the Isle of Oléron. After having sacrificed
his old allies, the Hébertistes, the Dantonistes, and the
Robespierristes, he himself had fallen. When moved later
from Oléron to Saintes, he succeeded in escaping from prison.
The <i>coup d’état</i> of the eighteenth Brumaire restored him to
liberty. We need not follow in detail his further adventures.
When Louis XVIII gained the throne of his ancestors by
the aid of foreign bayonets, Barrère fled to Brussels. The
revolution of July put an end to his exile, and he returned to
the south of France, and settled at Argelez, where he died
14 January, 1841.</p>

<p>His memoirs in four volumes were published under the
editorship of Hippolyte Carnot and David d’Angers, in 1843.
They are replete with disingenuousness in the representation
of the part he played, as also of falsehoods, that can be proved
to be such by reference to the contemporary files of the
<i>Moniteur</i>.</p>

<p>Macaulay, at the opening of his long and brilliant essay on
Barrère, <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Our opinion is this: that Barrère approached nearer than
any person mentioned in history or fiction, whether man or
devil, to the idea of consummate and universal depravity. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
him the qualities which are the proper objects of hatred, and
the qualities which are the proper objects of contempt, preserve
an exquisite and absolute harmony. In almost every
particular sort of wickedness he has had rivals. His sensuality
was immoderate; but this was a failing common to him with
many great and amiable men. There have been many men as
cowardly as he, some as cruel, a few as mean, a few as impudent.
There may also have been as great liars, though we never met
with them or read of them. But when we put everything together&mdash;sensuality,
paltroonery, baseness, effrontery, mendacity,
barbarity&mdash;the result is something which in a novel
we would condemn as a caricature, and to which, we venture
to say, no parallel can be found in history.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At the close of the article Macaulay says in reference to
Hippolyte Carnot, who states that Barrère was at no time
a sceptic, that he was the author of a pious treatise, entitled,
<i>Of Christianity and its Influence</i>, as also of a book of meditations
on the <span class="locked">Psalms:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This makes the character complete. Whatsoever things
are false, whatsoever things are dishonest, whatsoever things
are unjust, whatsoever things are impure, whatsoever things
are hateful, whatsoever things are of evil report; if there be
any vice, and if there be any infamy, all these things, we knew,
were blended in Barrère. But one thing was still wanting,
and that M. Hippolyte Carnot has supplied. When to such
an assemblage of qualities a high profession of piety is added,
the effect is overpowering.</p>

<p>“We have no pleasure in seeing human nature thus degraded.
We turn with disgust from the filthy and spiteful
Yahoos of the fiction; and the filthiest and most spiteful
Yahoo of the fiction was a noble creature when compared with
the Barrère of history. But what is no pleasure M. Carnot
has made a duty. It is no light thing that a man in high and
honourable public trust should come forward to demand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
approbation for a life black with every sort of wickedness, and
unredeemed by a single virtue. This M. Hippolyte Carnot has
done. By attempting to enshrine this Jacobin carrion, he has
forced us to gibbet it; and we may venture to say that, from
the eminence of infamy on which we have placed it, he will not
easily take it down.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Strange irony of fate. In Barrère’s native town, his
victim, Danton, only less detestable than himself, is glorified
with a monument, a statue in bronze. After Danton, perhaps
Tarbes will erect one to Barrère.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Bagnères</span> de Bigorre is a town, but it is country
as well; it has the amusements and dissipations provided
by a place of public resort, but it has also lovely and
quiet resting-places in mountain solitudes.</p>

<p>It swarms during the season with water-drinkers, bathers,
loungers, ladies who wear elegant toilettes, and bucks turned
out by the best Parisian tailors. But it also contains marble
works, linen factories, and women who are skilful at the
knitting of the so-called Barèges shawls. The wool is from
Spain, the finest Merino, and this enables them to make the
shawls delicate as lace.</p>

<p>To the south lie the mountains rising steeply, and commanded
by the Pic du Midi. For long a rivalry existed
between the Bigorriens and they of Roussillon as to whether
the Pic du Midi or the Canigou was the loftiest mountain of
the Pyrenean chain; indeed, some claimed for each that it
was the highest peak in Europe. In both cases the mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
was due to the position of each mountain starting boldly out
of the plain.</p>

<p>It was due to Ramond that the Pic du Midi was forced to
lower its pretensions. In 1787 this secretary of the Cardinal
de Rohan ascended the mountain, and on reaching the summit,
and seeing before him to the south the perpetual snows of the
gleaming glaciers above the Cirque of Gavarnie, he realized
what had not before been suspected, that the Pic du Midi was
but a mountain of the second order. Then the inspiration
took him to explore the whole range. He was engaged for
fifteen years on the task, and he was the first to reveal to
French people what the Pyrenees really were. Till he had
explored them they knew nothing about the chains save what
they saw from the plains, and from the passes leading into
Spain, for at that time no roads had been engineered up the
gorges. The visitor went no farther than to Laruns in the
Val d’Ossau, and Pierrefite in that of Argelez, unless he committed
himself to a guide, and mounted a mule, and was led
over wild heights along mere tracks.</p>

<p>The explorations of Ramond and his successors have been
recorded with humour by H. Béraldi in his book, <i>Cent ans
aux Pyrenees</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He accomplished,” says Ardouin-Dumazet, “that which
ought to have been done for the Alps; they also were undiscovered,
scientifically, till the year 1787. For, be it observed,
Ramond received his inspiration on the top of the Pic du Midi,
in the same year in which Saussure reached the summit of
Mont Blanc, along with Jacques Balmat.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The mountains rising steeply to the south of Bagnères
render the place cool in summer, when some of the sun is cut
off; but it is a dreary residence in the winter, for the same
reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
There are springs of various temperatures and mineral
components, ferruginous, sulphurous, etc., advertised as good
for nearly every complaint under the sun. It was the Roman
Aquæ Convenarum, and visitors may now bathe in the marble
basins in which Gallo-Roman ladies and gentlemen dipped.
Bagnères was always a town, and in the Hôtel de Ville are
preserved archives containing much relative to the history
of the place; among these is a charter of Esquirat, Count of
Bigorre, confirming the customs and liberties of Bagnères,
dated 1251.</p>

<p>The history of the town is one of untroubled serenity till
the times of the Wars of Religion. Captain Lizier, the Huguenot,
on occupying Tarbes, imposed a heavy subsidy on the
neighbouring towns, Bagnères included. But Bagnères
demurred to raising the contribution demanded. Lizier
marched to it, got hold of the governor, Beaudéan, and shot
him. The people of Bagnères resolved on revenge. They
drew the terrible captain into an ambuscade and killed him
to the shout of “Remember Beaudéan!”</p>

<p>On the summit of the Pic du Midi is an observatory,
erected by the energy of two men: Vaussenat and General
Nansouty. Vaussenat was a native of Grenoble, born of a
labouring family in 1837. He was admitted into the school
of arts, and traded at Aix, and on leaving it was engaged in
search for metals in Savoy. But summoned to the Pyrenees
to manage some mines there, he married a niece of a general
at Bagnères, and settled there. He saw, what indeed others
had seen before him, that the Pic was admirably suited for
a meteorological observatory, but he could not induce the
Government to take any steps towards its construction.
However, he managed to communicate his enthusiasm to
General Nansouty, and between them the foundations were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
laid and the work was begun. The general took up his abode
in the cabin of Sencours, just below the terminal cone, where
he passed winter and summer registering his observations,
whilst Vaussenat travelled through France, lecturing, exhorting,
wringing money for the work out of learned societies
and from generous individuals. Nansouty underwent great
hardships. On one occasion, in December, 1874, a furious
tempest burst over the refuge of Sencours, and twelve feet
of snow was heaped on the roof, one of the windows was
blown in, and the door gave way. It was absolutely necessary
to quit the place. Nansouty, aided by his two companions,
took seventeen hours struggling through the snow to reach
the bottom, a distance that can easily be mounted in two
hours and a half.</p>

<p>The observatory was completed in 1882, and was made
over by these two energetic men to the State, whereupon
Vaussenat was appointed director of the observatory. He
lived till 1891, when he fell ill in it. He was being conveyed
down the mountain, when one of the bearers slipped, and
Vaussenat was flung down a steep descent of ice. He was
taken up and carried to Bagnères, where he succumbed eight
days after.</p>

<p>Bagnères is at the mouth of the Val de Campan. In it are
the ivy-mantled ruins of the Castle of Asté. They are inconsiderable,
and in themselves hardly deserve a visit. But
they are of some historic interest, as this Château d’Asté
was the second cradle of the dukes of Grammont. The barons
d’Asté, early in the sixteenth century, became viscounts, and
Menard d’Aure, Viscount Asté, had the good luck to marry
the heiress of Grammont. Thenceforth his descendants
assumed the title of counts of Grammont and viscounts of
Asté.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Their principal residence now became Grammont, in
Labourde, on the Bidouze; but for hunting the wolf and the
bear, and in the heat of summer they came to Asté. Here
it was that the amorous Henri Quatre was wont to visit la
belle Corisande, wife of Philibert de Grammont, who died
at the age of twenty-eight, in 1580. Diana, or la belle
Corisande, was the only daughter of Paul, Viscount Louvigny.
By her husband she had Anthony, Count of Grammont, and
Guiche, also of Louvigny, Seigneur of Bidache, Viscount Asté,
Viceroy of Navarre, Governor and Perpetual Hereditary
Mayor of Bayonne. One of his sons, Philibert, married
Elizabeth, daughter of George, Earl of Hamilton. Her
picture is in the National Portrait Gallery, and one wonders,
looking at it, how she could have been called “la belle Hamilton”
in the French Court.</p>

<p>Philibert and Elizabeth had a daughter, Claude Charlotte,
who married Henry Howard, Earl of Stafford. It was of
Philibert, born in 1621, and who died in 1707, that the
entertaining memoirs were written by Anthony Hamilton.
It has been well <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The history of Grammont may be considered as unique:
there is nothing like it in any language. In drollery, knowledge
of the world, various satire, general utility, united with
great vivacity of composition, Gil Blas is unrivalled; but as a
merely agreeable book, the <i>Memoirs of Grammont</i> perhaps
deserve that character more than any which was ever written;
it is pleasantry throughout, and pleasantry of the best sort;
unforced, graceful, and engaging. Some French critic has
justly observed that if any book were to be selected as affording
the truest specimen of perfect French gaiety, the <i>Memoirs of
Grammont</i> would be selected in preference to all others.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the church of Asté is a white marble statue of the Virgin
that is an object of great veneration; also a painting attributed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
to Philippe de Champagne. The village of Beaudéan was
the native place of the surgeon Larrey, born in 1766, who
behaved with great self-devotion in the battle of Eylau and
the retreat from Moscow. Napoleon I said that he was the
most honest man he had ever known, and the most disinterested.
He created him a baron, and bequeathed to him
100,000 francs. Larrey died in 1847. The house in which he
was born is a humble cottage; he bequeathed it to the parish
that it might be turned into a school.</p>

<p>Campan, that gives its name to the somewhat overpraised
valley, is chiefly known for the marbles it produces. The
peristyle of the Grand Trianon, the new and vulgar opera-house
at Paris, have employed this splendid marble. Even
Berlin has had recourse to its quarries for twenty-two columns
of the royal palace.</p>

<p>There are several mountain tarns more or less accessible
from Bagnères. That most easily reached&mdash;but taking six
hours&mdash;is the Lac Bleu, a beautiful sheet of water of the most
intense sapphire-blue, girded about by rocks of a golden
yellow. It covers 98 acres, and is 360 feet deep. The spirit
of utility has mounted to this height, and bridled the outflow,
and uses it for economic purposes. A tunnel 900 feet long
has been bored through the rocks on the north side of the
lake, to draw off the water as needed in times when the Adour
has dwindled to a thread, and cannot feed the channels of
irrigation needed in the plain.</p>

<p>Other tarns are the Lac de Peyrelade, lying in a cirque
under the Pic du Midi, also the Lac d’Isaby.</p>

<p>Many delightful valleys open out into the Val de Campan,
The longest of these is that through which flows the Oussonet,
that reaches the Adour some way below Bagnères; but a
good road takes directly from Bagnères to the lateral valley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of Labassere, famous for its slate quarries. The excavations
are in the flanks of the mountain, and are numerous. The
products are brought down by a funicular contrivance
worked by electricity, taking the place of the zigzag road by
which oxen formerly conveyed the slates below. The men
who split the slates wear heavy sabots scooped out of billets
of beech that have not been shaped externally, so as better to
resist, should the sharp, cutting flakes fall on the feet. The men’s
legs are bound about thickly with rags to protect them from
the same danger, as the slate cuts like a razor. The slate-splitters
form the aristocracy of the trade, and although
their labour is less considerable than that of the quarrymen,
they receive double the pay of these latter. For a slate-cutter
has to learn the art before he is aged fourteen, whilst
the muscles are most flexible. At the age of twenty he has
to undergo military service, and when he returns to his shed
and tools, at the age of twenty-four, finds it very difficult to
recover the skill he possessed before he donned uniform.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and perplexing themes connected
with the Pyrenees is the origin of the Cagots, a “race
maudit,” that was found throughout the chain, but not there
solely. It existed as well in Brittany.</p>

<p>In a considerable number of churches may be seen the
Cagots’ door, through which alone they might pass into a
portion of the church reserved for them, and cut off from the
rest, and where alone they might assist at divine worship.
In some of the towns are streets called Rues des Cagots, in
which these outcasts herded. At one time they were not
suffered to inhabit the villages, but were relegated to isolated
hamlets, and they had separate burial grounds. They might
not associate with the more privileged natives, and inter-marriages
with them were strictly interdicted. They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
required to wear a distinctive badge&mdash;a goose’s foot in red
cloth attached to one shoulder. The expression “Cagot”
is still used as a term of opprobrium. But when one asks to
be shown a Cagot, after some hesitation, a <i>cretin</i> or a poor
creature afflicted with a <i>goître</i> is pointed out.</p>

<p>But the original Cagot was not such.</p>

<p>Jean Darnal, a solicitor in the Parliament of Bordeaux,
thus describes the Cagots, whom he calls Gahets, in his
<i>Chronique Bourdeloise</i>, 1555.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The magistrates gave orders that the Gahets should reside
outside the town on the side of S. Julien, in a little faubourg
apart, that they should not leave it without wearing conspicuously
a bit of red cloth. These are a sort of lepers, with the
disease in an undeveloped condition, with whom it is ill to
associate. They are carpenters by trade, and capital workmen,
and gain their livelihood by this trade in the town and in the
country.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One notion concerning them was that they descended
from the carpenter who had made the cross of Christ; and
most of them, though by no means all, actually were carpenters.
Florimond de Rémond, councillor of the Parliament
of Bordeaux, wrote concerning them in 1613:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We see in Guyenne this race, commonly designated
Cangots or Capots, one which although Christian and Catholic,
holds no communication with others, and may enter into no
alliance with other Christians; even to live in their towns is
not allowed. They are not suffered to approach the Holy
Table along with other Christians, and have a place set apart
for them in the churches. The people are convinced that they
are diseased, that their breath and sweat is malodorous, and
that they are to some extent lepers. This is why that in many
places, as at Bordeaux, they are constrained to wear a scrap of
red cloth on one shoulder.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Florimond goes on to say that he believes them to be
descended from the Arian Goths, and that Cagot is derived
from <i>Canis Gots</i>, or Dogs of Goths.</p>

<p>Popularly they were held to have certain distinguishing
characteristics&mdash;ears furred like those of bears and destitute
of the lower lobe. That they had stinking breath, and white
granular spots under the skin in parts of the body, indicating
undeveloped leprosy. In parish registers they were always
designated in entries of baptisms and marriages and burials
as Cagots or Capots.</p>

<p>F. Michel, in 1847, published a work upon them. He
went through the Pyrenees, and recorded how many families
of Cagots remained, and where they resided.</p>

<p>The theory of their origin as propounded by him was that
they were descended from the Spanish Christians who were
driven over the Pyrenees by the Moors, and whom the natives
received with scant hospitality, and continued to look upon
as intruders. One reason for the adoption of this wild
theory was that in ancient documents they are frequently
called Crestiaas. Undoubtedly refugees from Spain did settle
in parts of the Pyrenees, but there exists no evidence to show
that they were looked down upon. Moreover, Cagots were
found also in Brittany, and Michel’s theory does not fit in
with this fact.</p>

<p>Now the word <i>cagot</i> is comparatively modern. A Cagot in
old documents is called <i>Capot</i> or <i>Crestiaa</i>. Capot comes from
<i>caput mortuum</i>, a legal expression used of one who is outside
the pale of the law; the word is still employed in Germany
for what is broken and of no further use. <i>Es ist caput.</i></p>

<p>The original Cagots were probably lepers, gradually recruited
from the native population. A religious service was
said over a man on whom were discovered the marks of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
disease. It was a form of funeral. Earth was cast upon him,
and he was declared to be legally and socially dead.</p>

<p>Precisely the same regulations were applied to the Cagots
that were made for lepers. They were forbidden to spit in
the roads, and to walk in them barefooted. If constrained
to handle anything that had to be used by those who were
sound, they must wear gloves. They might not marry out
of their caste or company. They were relegated to live and
be buried apart from all others.</p>

<p>When we consider this identity of regulation, as also that
the Cagots are spoken of by all old writers as quasi-lepers,
as that in popular belief they were held to have on them marks
of undeveloped leprosy; when, further, we see that their old
designation comes from <i>caput mortuum</i>, I think it is hard not
to arrive at the conclusion that the Cagots were the descendants
of sequestrated communities of lepers. But such is the
recuperative power of Nature, in the healthy surroundings
of the mountains, in its pure air and in wholesome diet, that
the descendants of the lepers in course of time shook off the
disease and became sound and robust men and women.</p>

<p>The Church in the eighteenth century made an effort to
break down the wall of separation, the occasion for the
existence of which had ceased.</p>

<p>We hear of an archdeacon when visiting one church had
his indignation roused by seeing the Cagots huddled together
in a side chapel apart from the rest of the congregation.
Taking the Blessed Sacrament in his hands, he marched out
of the church through the Cagots’ chapel and door, and signed
to the congregation to follow him. After a moment’s hesitation
they obeyed, and from that day the prejudice against
these outcasts failed in that parish. In the Middle Ages no
Cagot could become consul, mayor, juror, or be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
to Holy Orders. But De Romagne, Bishop of Tarbes, who
died in 1768, ordained to the priesthood several members of
this proscribed race.</p>

<p>It was due to the French Revolution, that beat down
all barriers, that the distinction between Cagots and other
men was wholly obliterated. In the Val de Campan, between
four and five miles from Campan itself, is a hamlet, situated
high up on the mountain side, that is occupied by six families,
all by descent Cagots. The place where they live is called
“Le Quartier des Cagots.” Doctor Abadie, about 1840,
wrote concerning <span class="locked">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I know the heads of these families. They are carpenters.
Half a century ago these families intermarried among themselves,
and were not suffered to contract unions outside their
narrow circle. Now they are mingled with and are melted into
the mass of the population. In physiognomy they have nothing
peculiar. One remarks only that the individuals of the families
Pescadère, Latoure, Lacôme, and Daléas have a white skin
and grey eyes; but this is perhaps due to a lymphatic constitution,
the result of living in a cold and damp locality.”</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Dufresne, who filled an important, though subsidiary,
post in the administration of finances under Necker, and whose
bust, under the First Consul, was placed in the hall of the
Treasury, in recognition of the public services he had rendered,
was by birth and ancestry a Cagot; so we see that careers were
open to these members of an outcast and despised race even
before the Revolution. What that great upheaval did for them
was to destroy the popular prejudice entertained against them.</p>

<p>The derivation of the word <i>cagot</i> has been given; that of
<i>crestiaas</i> is not so simple. The name is never spelt with an
<i>h</i> in early documents, as if it were derived from Christians.
It probably comes from these unfortunates having been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
originally compelled to wear a bit of red cloth on the cap as a
cock’s comb, or <i>crest</i>, and that later this more conspicuous
mark of infamy was modified into one placed upon the
shoulder. Still, however, the expression “the crested”
was applied to them.</p>

<p>It is in vain to look for a genuine Cagot at the present
time, and in the words of an old ballad sung by the <span class="locked">people&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="subhead">THE VAL D’AURE</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Mauvezin&mdash;Escaldieu&mdash;Lannemezan&mdash;The Neste&mdash;The lakes utilized&mdash;Lortet&mdash;Fortified
caves&mdash;Marble quarries&mdash;Sarracolin&mdash;Canal&mdash;Val

d’Orredon&mdash;Republic.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Before</span> the train reaches the dreary moorland of
Lannemezan, on its way from Tarbes to Toulouse, a
glimpse is obtained of a picturesque village grouped about
a castle on a pointed rock. This is Mauvezin, the Bad Neighbour,
<i>par excellence</i>. It witnessed many exploits during the
English occupation of Guyenne. It was besieged in 1374
by the Duke of Anjou, at the head of 8000 men. The strength
of the fortress was such that it would have been impregnable
had it not lacked a well within the walls. The besiegers cut
off communication with the water-supply, and as not a drop
of rain fell during the six weeks of the siege, the garrison was
constrained to come to terms. The Duke of Anjou allowed
them to depart, saying: “Get you gone about your business,
each one of you, to your several native lands, without entering
any fort that holds out against me; for if you do, I engage
to get hold of you, and deliver you up to Jocelin (the headsman),
who will shave you clean without a razor.”</p>

<p>Upon the tower, which bears the arms of Béarn, may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
seen the device, “J’ay belle dame.” It was a fancy of the
boy Gaston, son of Gaston Phœbus, when he was affianced to
Beatrix d’Armagnac, to whom Mauvezin was given as a
dower by her father, Count John II. But Gaston was murdered
by his father, as already told, before the marriage was
consummated, and Beatrix was afterwards married to a
viscount of Milan.</p>

<p>Near Mauvezin are the remains of the once famous Abbey
of Escaldieu. The church was destroyed by the Huguenots,
and rebuilt in the seventeenth century. It is devoid of interest,
and is now converted into a coach-house. Only the
chapter-house remains of the original abbey, a structure of
the fourteenth century, the vaulting sustained by marble
pillars.</p>

<p>The great mass of Lannemezan, lying across the threshold
of the Val d’Aure, diverts the Neste from flowing north, and
turns it to the east, just as the heap of the <i>lande</i> of Pontacq
acts at the mouth of the Lavedan, but there deflects the Gave
to the west. It falls into the Garonne at the confines of the department,
which also for the same reason takes an easterly
course for some way, then struggles to the north-east, and
only after passing Toulouse turns to take its direction so as
to empty itself into the Atlantic. The Neste is a river of
very great importance. It rises in two main branches under
crests clothed in eternal snows, discharging glaciers into a
series of upland lakes. These natural reservoirs have been
artificially raised, and their waters conducted into a canal
that is carried high above the bed of the river, so as to convey
its fertilizing streams over the plateau of Lannemezan. The
lake of Caillaouas, under the Pic de Batchinale, and the
glacier cirque of the Gours Blancs has been captured at the
head of Neste de Luron, and the lakes of Aumar, Aubert,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Caplong, and Orredon, that feed the other Neste of Aure have
also been utilized for the same purpose, at an enormous expense
and by remarkably daring works of engineering. This
has had a subsidiary advantage, that the superb scenery
at the sources of these streams is now accessible by good
roads, whereas formerly it could be reached only by difficult
and dangerous mule-paths.</p>

<p>At La Barthe the Neste debouches from the mountains
through a deep valley, the canal passing above it on the left
bank; and although the river has been thus tapped, it still
continues to bring down a considerable amount of water,
the overflow from its reservoirs far away in the laps of the
high mountain ridge.</p>

<p>The Val d’Aure constituted a viscounty, and of the viscounts
there were several branches: one that of the Viscounts
of Larbouste, another that of the viscounts of Asté, one of
whom, as already mentioned, married the heiress of Grammont.
The whole of Aure was under the overlordship of the counts
of Armagnac.</p>

<p>La Barthe, commanded by a castle of the end of the
eleventh century, will not long detain a visitor. But a short
way above it is the village of Lortet, where are caverns in the
face of the limestone cliff that have been occupied and fortified,
it is thought, originally by the Saracens and the Visigoths;
but the structures that remain, notably the tower,
were the work of the Templars, to whom were confided the
defence of most of the passes of the Pyrenees. At Hèches
is a picturesque, ivy-clad tower occupying the summit by
a rock. Here are quarries of marble, rose-coloured, grey,
and white, spotted with black; as also of black marble
veined with white. But the principal marble quarries are
farther up, at Sarrancolin on the left bank, others are on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
right. Those on the former are famous. The finest are red,
veined with grey, or flesh tint with yellow veins; other
marbles are green, blue, violet. Versailles was adorned with
columns of Sarrancolin. Thence comes the marble now
employed in the Louvre for most of the pedestals.</p>

<p>The church of Sarrancolin was originally strongly fortified,
and served as the key to the valley; it is early of the twelfth
century, with Romanesque windows. There are no aisles,
it is a cross church. The choir grating is of the fifteenth
century. In the church is the shrine of a Spanish bishop,
S. Ebbo, and is the sole specimen in the district of Limoges
work, and is of the thirteenth century. To the north of the
church is the chapter-house in ruins. Fragments of the town
walls remain, as does a gateway and tower of the fifteenth
century. The houses are all built of the marble of which
the hill is formed on which the place stands, and they are
crowded about the church, in the constrained area within the
old walls. The place recommends itself to the painter and
to the archæologist.</p>

<p>The canal takes its waters from the Neste above the little
town, and the river accordingly has in the upper portion of
the valley a freer and fuller flow.</p>

<p>But before we have mounted so far up the Neste, a diversion
may well be made to the valley of the Arros, which rises in
the mountains between the Val de Campan and that of Aure.
We might have supposed that it would speedily throw itself
into the Adour or the Neste. But not so. It holds on its
independent course far away to the north, and does not
condescend to unite with the Adour till it enters the department
of Gers.</p>

<p>In this narrow valley, high up in the mountains, stand
near each other the two castles of Lomné and Espêche, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
which the following legend is told. I will give it in
the words of Mr. <span class="locked">Inglis:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The lords of these two castles were enemies, and constantly
disputed with one another the possession of the valley that lay
between their castles; but along with the enmity each was
enamoured of the wife of the other, though the ladies themselves
loved their own lords, and gave no encouragement to
the enemies of their husbands. At this time the Crusades were
published, and both of the nobles resolved to forget private
animosities for a time, and join the standard of the cross. It
so happened, however, that after travelling during several
days the devil entered into their hearts, and they both reasoned
after this manner: ‘My enemy has gone to the Holy Wars,
and has left both his lands and his wife. What hinders me
from returning and making the most of his absence?’ And
so both the Lord of Espêche and the Lord of Lomné returned
and took the road not to their own castle, but to the castles of
each other.</p>

<p>“But it so happened that on the very night upon which
these nobles left their own castles their ladies had a vision.
Each was warned in a dream of the intention of her husband
to return and go to the castle of his enemy. Accordingly
the ladies left their own castles to cross the valley, and met each
other by the way; and having communicated the mutual
vision, resolved upon a method of avoiding the danger. They
determined to change castles, and that very day they put their
resolution into effect.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile their lords arrived under cover of the night,
each at the castle of his enemy, and were greatly surprised to
find that no wonder was expressed at their return, for the ladies
had forewarned their household of what was to be expected;
but still greater was their surprise when, upon being ushered
into the castle hall, each beheld his own spouse. The explanation
that followed wrought a miraculous change. Touched
with the affection of their wives, they abjured their mutual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
enmity, swore unutterable fidelity to their own wives, and set
out in company together for the Holy Land.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Arreau stands at the junction of the two rivers called
Neste, and also where the Lastie enters the stream. It has
a cheerful appearance. The church of Notre Dame is of the
fifteenth century, castellated, with additions a century later,
built on the foundations of a church of the twelfth century,
of which a good doorway remains. The chapel of S. Exuperius
is of the eleventh century, and has a Romanesque
portal. It stands above the Neste of Aure. The mairie
is over the wooden market-hall. The entrance to the
valley of the Neste de Luron is through a ravine with precipitous
sides. Presently it opens out and reveals the little
bourg of Bordères, commanded by the ruined castle of the
Armagnacs. For now we are in Armagnac territory, and
with this castle is connected the story of the last of that evil
and ill-omened race. Michelet says of <span class="locked">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Frenchmen and princes as they were become, their diabolical
nature broke out on every occasion. One of them
married his brother’s wife, so as to be able to retain the dower,
another married his own sister, by means of a false dispensation.
Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, who was almost king, and
ended so ill, had begun by despoiling his kinsman, the Viscount
of Frézenzaguet, flinging him into a cistern, along with his
sons, his eyes plucked out. This same Bernard, pretending
to be a servant of the Duke of Orléans, made war against the
English, but only worked for his own ends, for when the Duke
came into Guyenne he made no attempt to assist him. But
no sooner was that prince dead than he posed as his avenger,
brought up all the South to ravage the North, made the young
Duke of Orléans marry his daughter, and gave her as dower
his bands of robbers, and the malediction of France.</p>

<p>“What made these Armagnacs specially execrable was their
impious levity allied to their innate ferocity.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
The Armagnac territory extended as a strip from the
Garonne to the Pyrenees. It was a fertile and well-peopled
land; its principal towns were Auche, Mirande, Vic, and
Lectoure.</p>

<p>The Armagnac family derived from a Garcias Sanchez,
Duke of Gascony in the early part of the tenth century. He
was nicknamed the Hunchback, and he seems to have bequeathed
a moral distortion to his descendants.</p>

<p>John IV, Count of Armagnac, was especially associated
with the castle at Bordères; and his story must now be
told.</p>

<p>This headstrong man fell in love with his own sister,
Isabella, and failing in his application to Rome for a dispensation
to allow him to marry her, he forged one, and presented
it to the chaplain of the castle, and demanded that he
should unite them. When the priest demurred, Count John
threatened to throw him headlong from the window into the
river unless he obeyed. When others remonstrated, he
drew his dagger on them. The cowed chaplain submitted to
celebrate the incestuous nuptials.</p>

<p>The Pope now excommunicated the Count, and King
Charles VII vainly endeavoured to recall him to a better
mind; but Armagnac resisted kind instances, and defied
force. Soon after he associated himself with the insurrection
of the Dauphin. The Duke of Clermont was sent against
him. His guilty passion had enfeebled the mind of John,
and in place of resisting the invasion, he abandoned his
dominions, and fled with Isabella to the protection of his
relative, the King of Aragon. He was summoned by the
Parliament, and having been rash enough to appear, was
arrested and imprisoned. Soon after he managed to escape.
The sentence of perpetual banishment was passed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
him, and his dominions were forfeited. The Valley of Aure
was, however, exempted so far that it was granted as a dowry
to his sister.</p>

<p>Then, as his last place of refuge, he retired to the Castle
of Bordères, in the depths of the mountains. The once
powerful and haughty Count of Armagnac was reduced to
the deepest destitution, shunned by all, shrunk from even
by his own subjects in the valley of the Neste, as though he
were a leper or a Cagot. At last, impelled by his necessities
rather than moved by remorse, he begged his way to Rome to
obtain absolution for himself and for his sister. This was
granted, but on hard conditions for himself, and that Isabella
should retire into a convent at Barcelona.</p>

<p>At this time Louis XI ascended the throne of France, and
by him the Count of Armagnac was restored to his former
rank and possessions. He now married Jeanne, daughter
of the Count of Foix, and the past was forgotten, or at least
forgiven.</p>

<p>But this restless man, incapable of feeling gratitude for
favours, allied himself with the enemies of the King, Charles
the Bold, the Duke of Guyenne, and the King of England.</p>

<p>Louis XI took occasion of the first moment of tranquillity
allowed him by the ambitious projects of the Duke of
Burgundy, to chastise John of Armagnac. In 1473 he confided
the task to the Cardinal of Albi, who besieged him in
Lectoure. The town, which was strongly fortified, defended
itself bravely. Proposals of surrender were made to the
Count, but whilst negotiations were in progress, one of the
gates was forced, and John’s son, of the same name as his
father, was killed fighting in the streets. John IV of Armagnac
was stabbed in the presence of his wife, who was
pregnant at the time. By order of Louis XI, who had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
desire to see the line of Armagnac continued, she was thrown
into prison and poisoned.</p>

<p>The title and claim to the county now devolved on Charles,
another son of John IV; but Louis XI had him cast into
prison, and retained there till he died of chagrin. There
existed at the time another branch of the family, that had
likewise received favours from King Louis, and had repaid
them with treachery. Jacques d’Armagnac had been given
by Louis XI vast estates in Meaux, Châlons, Langres, and
Sens. The king had married Jacques to Louise of Anjou, and
had created him Duke of Nemours. But Jacques was false to
his benefactor, and joined in the League of Public Good
against him. At the Treaty of Conflans he returned to his
allegiance, swore fidelity on the relics in the Sainte Chapelle,
and had the governorship of Paris conferred upon him.
The very next year, 1469, he went over to the enemies of the
King, and sided with his cousin, John IV, entering with him
into negotiations with the English. But alarmed at the fate
that befell John, he solicited pardon, and took an oath of
fidelity, the most solemn and binding that could be devised.</p>

<p>Two years later, when Louis XI was in embarrassment,
the Duke refused the King the succour he demanded, and
prepared to lay his hands on Languedoc. No sooner was
Louis delivered from his anxieties than he besieged and took
Nemours, in his Castle of Carlat, and confined him in an iron
cage in the Bastille. His wife, feeling confident that he would
experience no mercy at the hands of the justly incensed
King, died during her confinement at Carlat.</p>

<p>Jacques d’Armagnac’s hair turned white within a few
days. He was not mistaken about the gravity of his position.
Louis was alarmed at these incessant conspiracies, and indignant
at the ingratitude of the Duke, whom no oaths could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
bind. In vain did Nemours implore permission to speak
with the King face to face; Louis refused to see him, and gave
orders that he should be tortured. One day, hearing that the
prisoner had been treated with some consideration, he wrote
sharply to the gaoler, “Give him Hell (the extremity of
torture); let him suffer Hell in his own chamber. Take
care not to let him out of the cage except to be tortured.”
Jacques d’Armagnac was executed on 10 July, 1477. The
assertion often made, that by the order of the King his children
were placed under the scaffold so that their father’s blood
might fall over them, is asserted by no contemporary writers.
His sons died without issue, and so ended this wicked family.</p>

<p>For some way above Bordères the Neste of Luron traverses
a gloomy ravine; but then all at once it opens out and we
come on a basin well cultivated, fringed with woods, and
studded with twelve villages, about their church spires. The
road ascends steeply past slate quarries that send down their
avalanches of grey refuse over the base of the hill surmounted
by the donjon of Gélos. It is still a long way on to the Lac
de Caillaouas, that lies at the height of 3500 feet, and covers
120 acres; its blue waters are fed by some small tarns higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
up under the glaciers of the Gourgs Blancs. This is one of
the scenes of most savage grandeur in the Pyrenees. The
lake is of great depth, and swarms with trout. A tunnel has
been driven fifty-five feet below the surface through the rock
that retains the lake, and through this the water can be
drawn off to supply the deficiencies in the Neste and the
canal that leads from it in time of drought. The work was
completed in 1848.</p>

<p>The other Neste, that of Aure, is of even more economic
importance. It rises under the Pic de Campbieil, 9550 feet;
but receives a large influx of water from the Neste de
Couplan that is supplied from a whole series of lakes, the
largest of which is Orredon.</p>

<p>Above Arreau is Cadéac, one of the most ancient sites in
the valley. Hither came the representatives of the various
communes of the valley of the Neste to discuss their affairs,
and decide their policy; for here, as in Lavedan, the
people enjoyed great liberties, of which the Armagnacs did
not care to deprive them. Cadéac occupies a hill surmounted
by a feudal tower of the twelfth century. The church has
an early north doorway, and sculptures let into the walls.
The road passes up the valley under the porch of a chapel,
Notre Dame de Penetaillade, that has a curious fresco representing
the death of the Virgin on the façade. Vielle
Aure is a village lying on both sides of the river, with a church
of the twelfth century, and is an excellent centre for excursions.
The road then crosses the river and reaches Bourespe,
with a church of the fifteenth century, but a much earlier
tower. In the porch are curious paintings of the date 1592,
with representations of the deadly sins as ladies (why as
ladies, and not as men?), in the costume of the period,
mounted on strange beasts, and carrying behind them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
demons with hideous faces on their stomachs and breasts.
Pride is riding on a lion, Avarice on a wolf, Gluttony on a pig,
Luxury on a goat, Anger on a horse, and Idleness on an ass.</p>

<p>Surely Gluttony, Avarice, Anger are traits of man’s intemperate
passions rather than of woman’s humours. <i>Vitium</i>
is neuter, it will serve for either or none. But it is the old
story of the sculptor and the lion. He showed the King of
the Beasts a group finely carved that represented a man slaying
a lion. “Ah,” said the royal beast, “if a lion had been
the sculptor, the figures in the group would have been in
reversed positions.”</p>

<p>It was men, not women, who wrought these representations
of the cardinal vices.</p>

<p>Tramesaïgues (between the waters) occupies a rock, the
road passes below it.</p>

<p>The cluster of lakes in the Néouville basin of mountains
have been taken in hand as well as the Lac de Caillaouas.
The undertaking was difficult, as work was possible there
for only three months in the summer; all the rest of the
year the basin in which they lie is buried in snow, and
some of the tarns remain hard frozen. The largest of the
lakes is Orredon, lying 5600 feet above the sea; it is the lowest
of all, and receives the waters of the Lac d’Aubert and the
Lac Aumar, lying in one valley, separated by a gravelly ridge
of glacial rubbish; the Lac de Cap-de-Long reposes in another.
The works were begun in 1901 and terminated in 1905.</p>

<p>The Four Valleys&mdash;Magonac, Neste, Aure, and La Baronne&mdash;formed
another of those confederate republics of which
there existed so many in the Pyrenees. Of these Magonac,
with its chief town Castelnau, lay to the north of Lannemezan,
and was not properly a valley at all.</p>

<p>After the extinction of the Armagnacs, the overlordship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
passed to the kings of France, and each and all from Louis XII
to Louis XVI had to recognize and allow their very extended
privileges. From the year 1300 no seigneur could withdraw
an inhabitant of the Four Valleys from the jurisdiction of
their own judges; every citizen could own land, marry,
create an industry, or carry on any trade without authorization.
The right to bear arms belonged to every one; and
up to the eve of the Revolution the Four Valleys were exempt
from all war-tax and from the obligation to have troops
quartered on them.</p>

<p>La Fayette had no occasion to have gone to America to
have seen what republican self-government was. It existed
at his doors.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> Montréjeau the line branches off to Bagnères de Luchon
from the trunk to Toulouse. Montréjeau was Montroyal,
then Montreal, and then what it has now become
through deformation by the Gascon tongue. It was a bastide,
one of those artificial towns, created first by Edward I, and
then copied by great nobles, and by the kings of France, in
which every street was either parallel to another, or cut it
at right angles; and the houses were built in blocks, the whole
surrounded by walls, and the church usually serving as part
of the fortification.</p>

<p>Montréjeau was the capital of the Marquesate of Montespan.
The site is beautiful; and from the terrace, in clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
weather, the giants of the Pyrenees are seen to stand up due
south, and the chain stretches away into the vaporous distance,
east and west. The church has a huge octagonal tower that
served as keep to the fortress. The town stands a little
away from the station, to its disadvantage. From it visitors
usually start to see the Grotte de Gargas, the finest in the
Pyrenees; it might be visited equally well from S. Bertrand
de Cominges, but that no carriage can be obtained in that
decayed city. The train, moreover, halts at Aventignan,
the station next before reaching Montréjeau, to allow of a
visit to the grotto. The floor bristles with stalagmites,
and the stalactites from the roof have in several places
united with the stalagmites below. The strangest forms
have been assumed by the calcareous deposits, and the
custodian points out an organ front, a cascade, a bear, an
altar, and the bed of the savage. A spring rises in the cave.
Excavations made in the floor have exposed two beds of
palæontological deposits of different epochs: human bones,
flint tools, and bones of long extinct animals.</p>

<p>The discovery of this grotto is due to a series of ghastly
crimes committed just ten years before the outbreak of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>A panic terror pervaded the neighbourhood. Among the
rocks, somewhere, none knew exactly where, a monster had
his lair, fell upon those who travelled along the roads, robbed
them, maltreated them, carried them off, and devoured
them. And this monster was a man. In 1780 the Parliament
of Languedoc was called upon to try and sentence the
cannibal, who was actuated by no other motive than a
ravening appetite for human flesh.</p>

<p>Soon after the first disappearance of his victims every one
had come to the conclusion as to who he was. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Blaise Ferrage, commonly known as Seyé, a native of Ceseau,
born in 1757. He was a small man, broad-shouldered, with
unusually long arms, and was possessed of extraordinary
strength. By trade he was a stonemason, and had worked
at his trade till aged twenty-two. What induced him, in
1779, to throw up his work, quit his home and human society,
in order to abandon himself in solitude to his wolfish
appetite for blood, is not known; whether it was originally
due to his having committed some criminal act that
impelled him to fly to the rocks for refuge was never
ascertained.</p>

<p>High up in a limestone cliff he discovered a cavern, the
entrance to which was at that time so small that it had to
be passed through on all fours. But within it was spacious,
and provided with a running stream.</p>

<p>After he had spent the day in sleep Blaise would descend in
the twilight and ramble over the country through fields and
gardens, and appropriate to his use what he listed&mdash;fruit,
fowls, sheep, pigs&mdash;and bear them away in the darkness of
night to his den. Luck favoured and emboldened him, and
his ferocity increased. He delayed his return till dawn.
Lurking behind a wall or a bush he watched for milkmaids
who were so unfortunate as to come in his way. There was
no escaping him, for he carried a gun and was a sure shot.
When he pounced upon his prey he tore it to pieces, or else
carried it alive to his lair, and the shrieks could be heard from
afar, paralyzing the timorous peasantry with fear.</p>

<p>His name was a terror to all the country round. In the
evenings the spinners about the fire, the topers at the tavern,
spoke only of the werewolf. It was thought that his tread
could be heard at night among the withered leaves of autumn;
that his panting breath was audible about the doors; that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
his gleaming eyes pierced the fog. Men pictured him lying
on a ledge of rock half the day peering into the valley,
motionless, watching for and selecting his prey. Imagination
figured what the life must be of this man converted into
a wild beast, who had renounced the society of his fellows
to live among the rocks and tread the snow-fields, hearing
naught save the howl of the wind, the cry of the birds of prey,
and the baying of the wolves. As no single person who had
disappeared ever returned, as no bodies were ever found, it
was concluded that he was a man-eater.</p>

<p>Men he shot, strangled, or stabbed, and dragged their
carcases to his lair. But he preferred to fall on women,
especially such as were young; but the choicest morsels he
selected were little children. On one occasion he fell short of
powder and shot, and had the temerity to descend in full
daylight, and in market time, to Montégu. He was recognized,
and immediately the market people fled from him right and
left; the dealers deserted their stalls, and the would-be
purchasers hastened to take refuge within doors. He leisurely
possessed himself of what he required and sauntered out of
the place, not a man venturing to stay him.</p>

<p>At last the officers of justice seized him, and conveyed
him to prison. But he broke loose the same night, and again
disappeared among the mountains. The peasants were
convinced that he had a talisman concealed in his hair,
which enabled him to break the strongest chain and to open
every lock.</p>

<p>He was again secured, and this time his hair was cut and
searched for the supposed talisman there concealed, but, of
course, ineffectually. He again, nevertheless, effected his
escape.</p>

<p>Fear of him now passed all bounds. Girls and grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
women, even the strongest men no longer ventured abroad
after dark, not so much as to cross the street.</p>

<p>Then occurred two acts of violence which stirred the
magistrates to greater activity.</p>

<p>Ferrage entertained a suspicion that a certain landowner
in the district had instigated the police to track him. He
set fire to this man’s barns, stables, and cowsheds; and most
of the cattle and all his grain were consumed in the flames.
The other case was that of a Spanish muleteer who was
driving his beasts over the mountains of Aure. Ferrage
associated himself with the man on the way, volunteered to
act as his guide, and the muleteer was never seen again.</p>

<p>High rewards were offered for the apprehension of Blaise
Ferrage, but no dweller in the district dared attempt to earn
it. Moreover, to track and arrest the cannibal was not a light
matter. None knew precisely where he concealed himself, and
it was certain that he would send a bullet into the first man
whom he saw approach his place of refuge and concealment.</p>

<p>Finally he was taken, but only by subtlety. There was
a fellow who had been guilty of more than one crime, and
whom the officers of justice desired to secure. In order to
make his peace with them, this man offered to assist in capturing
Blaise, if he were assured of a free pardon and a reward.
This was promised. Accordingly he climbed the rocks,
yelling out the name of Seyé, by which Ferrage was commonly
known, and crying for help. The cannibal cautiously thrust
his head out of his cave, and seeing the man fleeing as for his
life beckoned him to approach. The refugee breathlessly
told him that he was flying from justice, that he had broken
out of prison, and entreated to be sheltered. Ferrage took
him in, and the fellow gained Blaise’s confidence. He lived
with him for awhile in his cave. However solitary a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
may be, he yet craves for the society of a companion, and
Blaise and this man became intimate. They went together
on predatory excursions, and the betrayer finally lured
Ferrage into an ambuscade laid for him, where he was taken,
and firmly secured by a body of police. He was led to prison
and kept there strongly guarded. The whole country breathed
with relief when it was known that he was in chains and behind
strong bars.</p>

<p>The trial was expedited and short. For three years this
monster had terrorized the countryside. The number of
charges of robbery and murder brought against him were
innumerable.</p>

<p>On 12 December, 1782, the Parliament of Languedoc
sentenced him to be broken on the wheel. He was then aged
twenty-five. On the following 13th December Ferrage was
executed. The sentence was carried out in the following
manner. The culprit was fastened to a cart wheel, his limbs
twined in and out among the spokes. The executioner smote
with an iron bar on the limbs and broke them, one by one.
Then came the <i>coup de grâce</i>, given across the chest.</p>

<p>It was estimated that he had murdered and eaten eighty
persons, the majority of these were women and children.
When he was executed crowds attended, palpitating with
alarm, for they expected that at the last moment he would
burst away and resume his murderous career.</p>

<p>He walked to death with florid countenance and with seeming
indifference to his fate. Whether the prison chaplain
induced him to express remorse for his guilt is not known.
Only when the mangled body was cast down from the wheel,
and consigned for burial to the grave-digger, did the crowd
feel satisfied that they were relieved from a nightmare of
horrors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
A little way above the station of Montréjeau the two great
Pyrenean torrents of the Neste and the Garonne unite their
waters and flow towards the east. The line to Luchon does
not follow the Garonne, that issues from a gorge, but crosses
it farther up at Barbazan, in a broad basin studded with
villages set in luxuriant verdure.</p>

<p>On an isolated hill, an outlier of the Pyrenees, rises a lofty
and beautiful church, with houses grouped about it; apparently
a stately medieval city, actually a poor village of
less than four hundred inhabitants. This is S. Bertrand de
Cominges. At one time it was as splendid a town as any in
Gaul, and was the capital of an important people, containing
from 30,000 to 50,000 souls. These could not all be accommodated
on the rock, and the town flowed down the side into
the plain, where now stands Valcabrères, the Vale of Goats.
S. Bertrand de Cominges is one of the few towns in France of
whose foundation we know the precise date.</p>

<p>Sertorius was one of the most extraordinary men in the
later times of the Roman Republic. He was a native of
Nursia, a Sabine village, born of obscure but respectable
parents, and a devoted son to his widowed mother. In
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 83 Sertorius went to Spain to organize a national revolt
against the intolerable oppression of Rome. Availing himself
of the superstitious character of the people, he tamed a
fawn, so that it accompanied him in his walks, lived in his
tent, and was regarded by the Iberians as a tutellary spirit
that communicated to him the will of the gods.</p>

<p>He maintained a stubborn resistance against the power
of Rome for many years, defeating army after army. In
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 77 Pompey was appointed by the Senate to command
in Spain, along with Metellus. Sertorius, at first, defeated
both. Pompey was obliged to appeal to the Senate for men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
and arms. Unless supported efficaciously, he declared that
he must infallibly be driven out of Spain. At length the
tide of success turned. Disaffection broke out among the
troops led by Sertorius, and a conspiracy was formed to destroy
him among some of his most trusted comrades. One
of these invited him to a banquet, at which they endeavoured
to provoke him to anger and make an excuse for a fray by
the employment of obscene language, which they were well
aware that he detested; then by grotesque and undignified
capers, as if they were drunk. Sertorius turned on his couch
so as not to see their buffoonery, when they rushed on him
with their daggers and slew him, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 72. His faithful adherents
fled through the defiles, and over the passes of the
Pyrenees, and settled in the district afterwards known as
the land of the Convenæ, and built Lugdunum Convenarum
as their capital in that same year, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 72.</p>

<p>Even after the fall of the Roman Empire this Lyons of
the Convenæ remained a rich and populous city. But a
terrible disaster fell on it in 584, that caused its utter and
irretrievable ruin. This forms one of the most striking and
detailed episodes of the history of the Franks by Gregory of
Tours. In the words of <span class="locked">Guizot:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Southern Gaul, that is to say Aquitaine, Gascony, Narbonne,
called Septimania, and the two banks of the Rhone
near its mouths, were not comprised in the partition of the
Frankish dominions. Each of the co-partners assigned to
themselves, to the south of the Garonne and on the coasts of
the Mediterranean, such and such a district, and such and such
a town, just as heirs-at-law keep to themselves severally such
and such a valuable jewel out of a rich property to which they
have succeeded, and which they divide among themselves.
The peculiar situation of these provinces, at their distance from
the Frank settlements, contributed much to the independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of Southern Gaul, which was constantly striving and partly
managed, in the tempestuous fortunes of the Frankish monarchy,
to recover its independence. It is easy to comprehend
how that these repeated partitions of a mighty inheritance,
these domains incessantly changing hands, must have tended
to increase the anarchy of the Roman and Barbaric worlds
thrown pell-mell one upon another, and fallen a prey, the Roman
to the disorganization of a lingering death, the Barbaric
to the fermentation of a new existence, striving for development
under social conditions wholly different from those of
their primitive life.”</p></blockquote>

<p>An opportunity seemed to offer for Aquitaine to establish
its independence.</p>

<p>The Merovingian dynasty was represented by an old man
and by two children, and the Aquitanians thought that their
chance had come to have a king of their own. They summoned
from Constantinople one Gundowald, reputed to be
of royal Frank blood.</p>

</div>

<p>Gregory of Tours <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Gundowald, who said he was the son of Clothair I, arrived
at Marseilles, coming from Constantinople. He had been born
in Gaul, had been carefully educated, taught letters, and, as is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the custom with kings of the Franks, had his hair flowing in
long curls over his shoulders. He was presented by his mother
to King Childebert (his uncle, King of Paris), and she said to
him, ‘Behold your nephew, the son of Clothair. His father
ever hated him, but do you take him to you, for he is your own
flesh and blood.’ And this Childebert did, as he had no son of
his own.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the prince whom the Aquitanians invited to rule
over them. Clothair I had divided the kingdom of the
Franks among his sons, but three of these were dead; Sigebert,
King of Metz, however, had left a son, Childebert II.
Gunthram, King of Orleans, still lived. Gundowald visited
his nephew, Childebert, at Metz, and was favourably received
by him. Childebert and Gundowald sent Duke Boso
with a deputation to Gunthram, King of Orleans, to demand
the recognition of the prince, and that he should be given
Aquitaine as a kingdom. The deputation was roughly received
by Gunthram at Orleans, seated on his throne.
“Pshaw!” said he, “Gundowald’s father was a miller, or,
to be more exact, a carder of wool.”</p>

<p>Then one of the deputies said boldly, “Do you pretend
that Gundowald had two fathers&mdash;one a miller, the other
a wool-carder? Who ever heard of a man having two
fathers?”</p>

<p>Another deputy broke out with&mdash;“Take care, King, the
axe that cut off the heads of your brothers has not lost its
edge.”</p>

<p>In a fury Gunthram ordered the embassy to be driven
out of the palace and pelted with horse-dung and rotten
vegetables.</p>

<p>The Aquitanians flew to arms; Gundowald was crowned
at Brives, and marched to secure Toulouse. The ecclesiastics
of the south to a man favoured the pretender. Gunthram<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
was alarmed, and at once detached his nephew Childebert
from the side of Gundowald, by the bribe of an offer of the
succession to the kingdom of the Franks after his death.</p>

<p>The reconciliation of the two kings discouraged the party
of Gundowald. The fickle Aquitanians were as hasty in
deserting him as they had been in acknowledging him. As a
large army of the Franks was pouring south, Gundowald
was constrained to throw himself into Lugdunum Convenarum,
along with the grandees most compromised, as
Duke Mummolus, and two bishops, Sagittarius and Waddo.</p>

<p>Duke Boso, who had been foremost in instigating the
rising, secured all Gundowald’s treasures and fled with them.
Mummolus and the bishops only waited for an opportunity
to betray him. The army of Gunthram surrounded the
town, lying all along in the plain. Then Mummolus and the
bishops advised the prince to throw himself on the mercy
of his brother Gunthram. “It was at your invitation,”
answered he, “that I came to Gaul. I was in Constantinople
with my little children, in high honour with the Emperor,
when Boso sought me out and informed me of the death of
all my brothers save Gunthram, without issue, and that
Childebert, my nephew, was a poor creature. I allowed
myself to be persuaded to return to Gaul; and now this
same Boso has stolen the treasures I had brought with me,
and has gone over to my brother who is warring against me.”
Then said Mummolus, “Do as we bid you. Divest yourself
of your golden baldric and sword and go forth. We swear
to you that no harm will befall you.” Seeing that nothing
else was open to him, that he could trust none of those who
had egged him on, he issued from the gates, and at once
Mummolus closed them behind him. Otto, Count of Bourges,
received the prince and surrounded him with armed men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Gundowald raised his hands to heaven and said, “Judge
Eternal, Avenger of the innocent! To Thee I commit my
cause, and I pray Thee to avenge me on my betrayers.”</p>

<p>As he was descending the hill, Otto dealt him a sharp blow
on the back that made him fall, saying, “This dauber of the
walls of churches and oratories is down at last!” Then
raising his spear he attempted to transfix him, but failed,
owing to the armour worn by the prince.</p>

<p>Gundowald sprang to his feet, and turned to reascend the
hill, when Duke Boso, as base as he was treacherous, dashed
a stone at his head and crushed in his skull. The prince fell,
and the men at arms, after making sure that he was dead,
tied his feet together, and dragged him around the camp with
jeers.</p>

<p>The rock down which Gundowald was thrown is still pointed
out. It is called Mattacan, the place where the dog was
slaughtered. It is some satisfaction to learn that Mummolus
gained nothing by his treachery. When the town was entered
by the troops of Gunthram he was put to death. The city
was delivered over to the soldiery of the King, and the inhabitants&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;were massacred, so
that, to use the expression of Gregory of Tours, there did not
remain even a dog alive in it&mdash;“ita ut non remaneret mingens
ad parietem.” The city was levelled, and the bishops of
Cominges, finding no asylum among the ruins, settled at
Valcabrères, where they erected a church dedicated to
S. Justus. This is an interesting structure, standing alone in
the fields, built out of the ruins. The choir, very archaic in
form and of rude construction, probably dates from its erection
after the destruction of the Lyons of the Convenæ. The
nave, less ancient, of the eleventh century, has been also
built of old materials. A delicious lateral portal enriched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
with sculptured capitals, and fine statues of life size, and a
bas-relief of Christ between the evangelistic symbols, is of
the twelfth century. Within are ancient columns taken from
the Roman town, and a curious stone sarcophagus or shrine
of the fourteenth century, much mutilated, and reached by
two stone flights of steps. It is not known whose tomb this
was. Against the wall at the end of the nave is the tombstone
of a priest named Patroclus, of the fourth century.</p>

<p>After five centuries of abandonment, one of the bishops of
Cominges resolved on the re-edification of the city of Lugdunum.
He built a cathedral on the height of the rock, in the
midst of the ruins. This was in the eleventh century, towards
its close, when religious fervour was at its height; and this
new church is one of the most beautiful monuments of medieval
art in the south of France. About the new cathedral
canons were installed; the prelate erected for them a residence
and a cloister. He built himself a palace, and in every
way encouraged the people to resettle on the site of their
ancient capital.</p>

<div id="if_p226" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p226.jpg" width="600" height="430" alt="" /><div class="caption">CLOISTERS, S. BERTRAND DE COMINGES</div></div>

<p>The man who did this, the second founder, was Bertrand
de l’Isle-Jourdain, and he has given his name to this new
foundation, or, to be more correct, the people have called the
new city on the old site after his name. Bertrand’s mother
was daughter of William Taillefer, Count of Toulouse. He
was trained in the abbey of Escaledieu, but quitted it for the
profession of arms. However, before long he abandoned the
life of a camp to accept a canonry at Toulouse. He was
appointed Bishop of Cominges about 1073, and ruled the see
for fifty years. According to popular legend, he killed a
dragon that infested the neighbourhood; and the stuffed
monster hangs in the church to this day. It is a crocodile
from the Nile. He died in or about 1120, and his day of commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
is on 17 October, when the decayed town is
thronged with pilgrims to visit his shrine.</p>

<p>At the time of the Papacy at Avignon Bishop Bertrand
de Got was elected Pope, and took the title of Clement V.
He retained a liking for the place, revisited it several times,
and contributed sums towards its completion; and to raise
money without having to dip into his own purse instituted a
grand Pardon or Jubilee, charged with Indulgences, for the
Feast of the Invention of the Cross (3 May). This is still
celebrated, and attracts pilgrims to gain the Indulgences,
during three days. The vaulting of the church was begun in
1304, and completed by Hugh de Châtillon in the middle of the
fourteenth century. The apse is surrounded by five chapels.
The windows of the choir, very tall and narrow, are partly
walled up, and partly filled with fragments of Renaissance glass.
The magnificent Renaissance woodwork choir-stalls, screen,
organ-case, and altar-piece are due to Bishop Jean de Mauleon,
and date from 1525. In a chapel is the stately tomb of
Bishop Hugh de Châtillon, who died in 1352; it is of white
marble, and was executed at least a century after his death,
probably at the expense of the Cardinal de Foix, to whom
also is due the mausoleum of S. Bertrand behind the high altar.</p>

<p>But bishops cannot create a town, even though they enrich
a site with a superb cathedral. S. Bertrand de Cominges
never thrived, and little by little the bishops tired of it, and
then abandoned it for their Château of Alan, near Aurignac;
they were rich men, enjoying large revenues, for the diocese
of Cominges, in addition to that part which is in France, comprised
also the whole of the Val d’Aran&mdash;that is to say, thirty-three
parishes under the Crown of Spain.</p>

<p>Some of them rarely visited S. Bertrand, some not at all.
One of them, Urban de S. Gelos, an ardent Leaguer, only went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
thither to dislodge the Huguenots, who thrice between 1569
and 1593 entered the town and committed great ravages.</p>

<p>At the Revolution the see was suppressed, and the small
world of canons, vicars-general, and diocesan functionaries
who had inhabited the capital of Cominges dispersed, and the
little town sank to be a <i>chef-lieu de Canton</i>, and then lost
even that dignity, which was transferred to Barbazan.</p>

<p>S. Bertrand would be abandoned altogether by its inhabitants,
who would settle on the plain were it not much resorted
to by visitors from Luchon, by artists and antiquaries, and
by pilgrims.</p>

<p>There were counts of Cominges from a very early period,
indeed from 900; but the county came to the Crown of France
in 1442 through a domestic quarrel.</p>

<p>Margaret de Cominges was left an heiress in 1376. She
married John III, Count of Armagnac Fézansac. He died in
1391, having had by her two daughters. She then married
Jean d’Armagnac Pardiac, who was aged eighteen. As she
treated him with contempt as a mere boy he was offended,
and left her so as to reside with his father. But after awhile,
finding that Margaret had installed a lieutenant in the county,
and refused him those rights in it which had been assured to
him by the marriage contract, he appealed to Count Bernard
VII of Armagnac for assistance. This treacherous
man went over to the side of Margaret, and when John
hastened to Auch to urge the Count to assist him Bernard
had him arrested, carried to a castle in the Rouergue, and
there blinded by a red-hot basin applied to his eyes. The
poor lad died in prison in great misery. Margaret being free
of her boy-husband, looked out for one who was a man, and
pitched on Matthew de Grailli, brother of the Count of Foix,
and married him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
But Matthew proved a little too much of a man for her.
He treated Margaret as roughly as she had treated Jean. He
shut her up in the Castle of Saverdun, where he retained her
for fifteen to sixteen years. At the end of that time she
appealed to Charles VII when he was at Toulouse, and
Matthew was forced to surrender her into the King’s hands.
Then Margaret, to vent her spite against her husband, made
over the county of Cominges, in 1442, along with all her
estates, to the Crown of France. Next year she died at
Poitiers at the age of eighty.</p>

<p>The Garonne does not rise in France, but in Spain, and, by
what is an apparent caprice, the frontier does not follow the
crests of the highest mountains, but runs north, making a
loop so as to include the Val d’Aran in Spain.</p>

<p>But though the valley is reached by a good carriage road
from France, and can communicate with Spanish neighbours
only by a mule path over a pass 8000 feet high and impassable
for many months in the year, yet the valley has pertained to
Spain since 1192.</p>

<p>Of the Val d’Aran more presently. We must first, after
the antiquity and decay of S. Bertrand, refresh ourselves with
the novelty and up-to-datedness of Luchon; certainly one of
the most delightful centres from which to radiate in all
directions, that is to be found in Europe. All the comforts,
distractions, and amusements that go to make a watering-place
pleasant are to be had there as elsewhere, and better than
elsewhere in the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>A Frenchman shall describe it, lest I should do it scant
<span class="locked">justice:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Forty thousand visitors come every year to Luchon,
bringing with them an atmosphere of luxury not to be found
to the same degree in other Pyrenean stations. Their artificial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
existence has for corollary an artificial existence in the population
living upon them:&mdash;Coachmen and postilions in the
livery of the Opéra-Comique, guides who have adopted an
imaginary Pyrenean costume. The hotel-keepers are not
behindhand; correctly dressed cavaliers, spruce amazons,
toilettes changed frequently during the day, toilettes the product
of the best Parisian dressmakers, affectation of the extreme
of fashion, such is the picture of life at Luchon. Even
for mountain excursions there must be a faultless costume.</p>

<p>“With the exception of a few guides worthy of the name
and knowing the loftiest crests, these cicerones in costume
conduct walkers to spots to which they could go perfectly well
without them. The mountains are very much humanized
here, there are plenty of carriage-drives, walks innumerable,
well kept up, to reach even great altitudes. But beyond all
this Luchon is one of the principal centres of Pyrenean-Alpine
climbing, it is the point of departure for bold climbers who go
to the Mont Maudit, the loftiest of all the chain, but on
Spanish soil” (Ardouin-Dumazet).</p></blockquote>

<p>But even easy ascents lead to superb and savage scenery.
The Lake of Seculejo is easily reached, and is accessible even
in a carriage. It stands 6500 feet above the sea, and is
the most visited of all the Pyrenean sheets of water. It
is a mere tarn, but is singularly beautiful, lying amidst
rugged mountains, with the eternal snows above it spilling
their melted waters into it in a fall of 620 feet, after having
paused to spread in two loftily situated tarns, one of which is
frozen almost throughout the year. Inglis thus describes it,
at a time when it was but occasionally <span class="locked">visited:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I dedicated a day to the Seculejo, and have seldom passed
one more to my mind. I left Bagnères de Luchon about sunrise.
The road to it is wild and pastoral, rapidly rising towards
the south, and having constantly in view the majestic scenery
that lies upon the Spanish frontier. The Lake of Seculejo is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
wild, solitary, and sombre. The low ripple of the water, the
noise of the cataract, and the cry of a bird of prey, are the only
interruptions of silence that are in keeping with the scene;
and these were the only sounds that disturbed its tranquillity
as I stood upon the margin of the water. The lake is entirely
surrounded by high mountains, excepting where it finds egress;
and its shores are generally bold and rugged. At the upper
end, a cascade falls from the top of a perpendicular rock into
the lake. After lingering upon the margin of Seculejo an hour
or two, I climbed up the eastern bank, by a path which has
almost the appearance of a ladder, and which, indeed, bears
the name of Scala. Having reached the summit of the bank,
I entered a gorge, through which I passed to a hollow lying at
the base of the mountain, called the Espingo; and, still proceeding
to ascend the first ridges of the mountain, I reached
the two lakes of Espingo. These are very elevated mountain
tarns lying almost in the region of snow. All is here sombre,
melancholy, rude, and dismal&mdash;great rocks, a few stunted
trees, and still, deep, dark water, are the features of the scene.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We return to Luchon. Do you desire health? It is to be
found there, if we may believe the advertisements of the
wonders wrought by its waters, more potent than that from
the lips of the Grotto of Lourdes: “Toutes les maladies de la
peau, comme d’autres de toute espèce, les maladies occassionées
par le lait répandu, quelques graves qu’elles soient,
les rheumatismes, maladies des yeux, maladies des parties
conservatrices des yeux, lésions d’oreille, maladie du système
osseux, blessures; gale ventrée, rougeole, maladies des articulations;
maladies des glandes salvaires; humeurs froides;
maladies des voies urinaires; catarrhe pulmonaire; asthme;
phthisie pulmonaire, obstructions de toutes sortes, et jaunisse.”
And, nevertheless, there is a cemetery at Luchon.</p>

<p>Luchon was well-known to the Romans, as the number of
<i>ex voto</i> altars to the god Ilixion that have been found go to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
prove. The name of this god of healing is to be recognized in
a very altered shape in the modern Luchon. In 1036 Luchon,
with Upper Cominges, passed as dower to the Crown of
Aragon. Later it was restored to the counts of Cominges.
In 1711 the valley was ravaged, and Luchon burned by
Charles of Austria, who was disputing Spain with the Duke of
Anjou.</p>

<p>No one staying at Luchon should omit to read J.&nbsp;H. Michon’s
powerful novel, <i>Le Maudit</i>, the scene of which is mainly
laid at S. Aventin on the Neste d’Oucil, a picturesquely
situated village, with an interesting church of the eleventh
and twelfth centuries. It has two towers&mdash;one at the west
end, the other at the transept. The <i>grille</i> is specially noticeable,
as it is ironwork of the twelfth century. The tomb of
the patron saint is in the church. He is said to have died in
the year 538.</p>

<p>One stormy night a bear bounced against the door of his
cell. Aventin spent the night in great alarm, but on opening
the door in the morning he saw the bear still there, crouched
on the threshold, and it stretched forth a paw to him. Then
the hermit perceived that a splinter of wood had entered it.
So he said, “Poor beast, thou wast in pain, and didst seek
relief, and I thought that thou wast raging for my life.” Then
he took the paw in his lap, drew out the splinter, bathed and
bandaged the wound, and let the bear depart. It is the story
of Androcles and the lion, without the termination.</p>

<p>Perhaps the finest excursion is up the Valley of Lys to the
Cirque of Crabioules, where the glacier sends down a fine fall,
the Cascade d’Enfer. Nothing can surpass the scenery in
this valley.</p>

<p>The Val d’Aran should be visited on account of its magnificent
scenery, running up as it does to the roots of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
gloomy Maladetta. On the way to it S. Béat is reached,
planted in a narrow defile, into which the sun penetrates
for little more than two hours in the day in mid-winter.
It owed its importance as a key to Spain, that is to say to
such part of Spain as is in the Val d’Aran; and it has a key
for its arms. It maintains a population of quarrymen.
The marble there has been exploited since Roman times
with long intermission. A votive altar has been discovered,
erected by Q.&nbsp;J. Julianus and Publicius Crescentinus to
commemorate their having been the first there to cut and
dispatch columns twenty feet long. In the Middle Ages
these white marble quarries were abandoned, but were
worked again under Louis XIV, when hence were sent the
marble basins for the gardens at Versailles. S. Béat is commanded
by a castle of the fourteenth century, with a keep
still more ancient. The castle is reached by steps, some hewn
out of the rock. A colossal statue of the Virgin in bronze
has been erected on the rock within the castle precincts.</p>

<p>From S. Béat it is not four miles to the frontier, at Pont-du-Roi,
where some speculators have built a casino; a restaurant,
and gambling tables are provided; but, of course, this
fact is veiled, and it is called La Société du Vélo Club du
Pont-du-Roi.</p>

<p>The Maladetta with its glaciers now bursts on the sight.</p>

<p>It is somewhat absurd that the Val d’Aran should not
pertain to France, with which it has a natural connexion.
Indeed the Spanish officials who come to the valley arrive
by train either from Bayonne or from Perpignan, and leave
it at the little station at Marignac near Luchon. The people
of Aran who drink Spanish wine have the barrels brought
round one way or the other by French lines, but do not pay
duty, only the long carriage; whereas French wine has to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
pay at the Customs, coming only a few miles up from the
level land.</p>

<p>The dialect is Catalan, but so is that of French Roussillon;
and nearly every man in Aran can speak French. The
position of the inhabitants is difficult, as for only two or
three months in the year can they reach a Spanish town
beyond the mountains, so that they must purchase French
goods, and these have to be examined at the custom-house,
and taxed, some heavily.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, at the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659
nothing was said about annexing Aran to France. Napoleon
alone saw the necessity for it, and did annex it in 1808;
but the treaty of 1815 restored it to Spain. As Aran is
now situated, inevitably smuggling thrives and cannot be
suppressed.</p>

<p>Viella is the capital of the district of Aran. Before reaching
it a monolith is passed, a prehistoric monument, supposed
to be dedicated to the presiding deity of the valley. Viella
is planted on the banks of the Rio Negro, and possesses a
church and chapels of massive construction, overcharged
with gilded decorations, in accordance with Spanish taste.
The houses are provided with balconies.</p>

<div id="if_p234" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p234.jpg" width="600" height="431" alt="" /><div class="caption">LE LAC D’OO</div></div>

<p>We are here at the roots of the Maladetta, the accursed
mountain, because devoid of vegetation, and near the Cirque
of Sabourede. The highest peak of the Maladetta is 10,230
feet, and in its flanks rises the western branch of the Garonne.
The melted waters of the glaciers of the peak Aneto falls into
a chasm, the Trou de Toro, and it was long supposed that
after an underground course the same waters broke forth
in the Goueil de Jouéou, which is the true source of the
western Garonne. But sufficient colouring matter has been
poured into the gulf to dye the water issuing from this spring,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
without its staining the source any more than the dye poured
into the <i>source</i> in the Lourdes grotto discoloured the water
a few yards distant, that issues from the taps from which the
miraculous fluid is drawn. Where the stream issues that
precipitates itself into the Trou de Toro has not yet been
discovered. There is no doubt about the source of the
eastern Garonne. That rises at the foot of the Port de Béret,
in two little springs that go by the name of the Eyes of the
Garonne, but which is speedily lost in the turbulent and
mightier stream of the Ruda descending from the snows of
Sabourede. From Luchon the passage into Spain by the
Port de Venasque is to be effected, disclosing views of mountain
crest and suspended glacier hardly to be surpassed in
Europe. A hospice is planted half-way, where is the custom-house.
“It is,” says the Commandant de Oliver-Copóns,
“like a great barrack in disorder, a muddle of hotel, pot-house,
and workshop. There are stables that can shelter
sixty beasts, but hardly a room in which a traveller can lodge
comfortably.” However, there is no need to stay the night
there; one can push on to Venasque, and make that a centre
of excursions to the lakes clustering at the heads of the wild
valleys that descend from the Pic d’Eristé, the Pic des Posets
and the Maladetta.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> railway lines in the central portion of the Pyrenees
converge on Toulouse, and to get across country
from west to east is no easy matter. In the Eastern Pyrenees
they form a cobweb amidst which the traveller gets entangled
and spends a day unprofitably in endeavours to extricate
himself, for French railway directors ingeniously contrive to
make through travelling by branch lines most difficult, or
at least most tedious. To reach S. Girons it is necessary to
run northwards from S. Gaudens to Boussens, then change
trains and turn the face due south, following up the Salat,
past the salt springs of Salies.</p>

<p>We now enter the old viscounty of Couserans, of which
the civil capital was Massat, and the ecclesiastical was
S. Lizier. It pertained for awhile to the counts of Carcassonne;
Roger II gave both the district and the bishopric to
his younger son, Bernard, with the title of viscount, in or
about 990. But in 1257 Esquivat, Count of Bigorre, inherited
the land from Roger, Count of Pallier, and thus the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Couserans passed into the possession of the house of Foix-Béarn,
and so to the kings of Navarre.</p>

<p>The capital of the whole country in early days was Lugdunum
Consoranorum, now S. Lizier, and one of the nine
cities of Novempopulania. The Couserans, situated between
the basins of the Ariège and the Garonne, has much the shape
of a vine-leaf, having the valleys of the Arac, Garbet, Salat,
and Lez converging at S. Girons into the one broad stream
of the Salat, as the stalk of the leaf. If S. Bertrand de
Cominges has fallen from its high estate to be a miserable
village, it is not alone in its fall, in that S. Lizier has shared
the same fate. But Lugdunum Convenarum went out in one
tragic drama of blood and flame. Lugdunum Consoranorum
is dying of slow decline, its life-blood sucked out of it
by the parasitic growth of S. Girons. Indeed, so low is it
fallen that the railway does not afford it a station, only a
<i>halte</i>. Once the fifth in order of size and splendour of the
cities of Novempopulania, it now shelters within its walls
not more than five hundred inhabitants. This was a double
town: one portion was the city, the other the <i>ville</i>; and
what is more, it possessed two cathedrals&mdash;one in the city,
Notre Dame; the other, S. Lizier, in the town. As just before
death a patient often brightens up, puts on an appearance
of renewed life, and enjoys buoyant hopes, only to sink in
relapse to death, so was it with this Lyons of the Couserans.</p>

<p>Bishop Bernard de Marmiesse (1653&ndash;80), not content with
the medieval residence of the prelates, erected an enormous
and splendid palace, commanding the whole town with its
long façade flanked by semicircular towers, embracing the
cathedral of S. Marie de la Sède within its walls. Where the
bishops ruled and feasted in purple and fine linen lunatics
are now installed. Lazarus has crept into the shell of Dives.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
The bishopric was suppressed at the Revolution and never
restored. There had been on the cathedral staff twelve
canons and twenty-four prebendaries, having under them a
swarm of sacristans, <i>curés</i> to relieve them of burdensome
duties, and workmen.</p>

<p>Ste. Marie de la Sède is a Renaissance church, but built
when the spirit of Gothic architecture had not gone out of
the land; but the portal is Romanesque. The interior
woodwork is of the eighteenth century, and is fine for its
period. To the north is the chapter-house, of the twelfth
century. The materials of which cathedral and palace were
built proceeded from the ruins of the Gallo-Roman city.</p>

<p>The other cathedral is more interesting. It consists of
a nave without aisles, and an apse constructed out of fragments
of Roman buildings, and over a Roman gateway.
The central tower is of the fourteenth century: octagonal,
lighted by windows with triangular heads, and the whole
crowned by a crenellated platform. It affects the Toulouse
style, and is of brick. The magnificent cloister of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries has thirty-two round-headed arches
resting on alternate single and double pillars with quaintly-carved
and varied capitals. Above it is an open walk or
cloister, with the pantiled roof supported on beams, dating
from the fifteenth century. Probably the town would expire
altogether were it not kept alive by the lunatics installed in
the episcopal palace, which is lighted by electricity, and such
light as is not wanted in the asylum is distributed over the
town.</p>

<p>Like S. Bertrand, this Lyons changed its name and assumes
that of one of the bishops, a native of Lerida, who is said to
have saved the city from destruction by the Visigoths by his
intercession. The town is built on the slopes of a hill above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the Salat. It communicates with the <i>halte</i> by means of
a steep-pitched bridge of the twelfth or thirteenth century,
consisting of three unequal arches. Into one of the piers is
built a votive inscription to the goddess Belisama, who was
identified by the Romans with Minerva. Another inscription
to this goddess has been found at Vaison. A tower formerly
stood in the midst of the bridge. Above, on the right bank
of the Salat, is a square tower that defended a fortified mill.
This mill has been reconstructed. The old city is enclosed
in the Roman ramparts forming an ellipse, flanked by a
dozen towers, of which six on the north side are square, and
the rest on the south are semicircular. Against the rampart
within is the episcopal keep of the twelfth century, rectangular,
and only to be entered by a wooden bridge that led to the
first story from the palace. The lower rests on Roman
foundations.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Couserans do not attract many visitors;
they have not the boldness of those farther west. The Pic
de Crabère reaches to 7200 feet, that of Mauberme to 8650,
that of Roujos to 8340. There is a little lake, the Lac
d’Arrainge, out of which flows the Isar, but it is insignificant;
others are above Aulus. The principal business of the people
in the upper valleys was the training of dancing bears, and
sometimes when a father married his daughter he would hand
over to his son-in-law as the <i>dot</i> a well-trained Bruin. But
the taste for seeing these beasts led about and made to stand
on their hind legs and plead for coppers has died out. There
is no further demand for bears, and the industry is expiring,
if not dead. Perhaps the last was seen by M. Ardouin-Dumazet:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“No sooner had we entered the hamlet of Sérac, with its
steep and muddy streets, than I asked after these strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
educators. Alas! it was a lost tradition. In all the commune
of Uston there was but a single little bear in training. Happily
he inhabited Sérac, so I could see him.</p>

<p>“A little girl conducted me to the grange in which the small
animal was shut up. It was still a baby, but its mark of slavery
was upon it, the ring through its nostrils, by means of which
the tamer can control it. The little bear, sitting up on its
hind paws, waddled and hopped incessantly, as if afflicted with
S. Vitus’s dance. Our visit seemed to please it; it invited
caresses, and rolled about at our feet. The people said that it
would be easy to tame the poor little bruin.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Bears are no longer hunted on the French side of the
Pyrenees, and those who seek for them must cross over the
Spanish frontier, where a good many are still to be found in
the forests. But, as already said, the demand for them has
ceased, not only to be led about, but to show in barber’s
yards as evidence that genuine bears’ grease is sold on the
premises.</p>

<p>This industry having failed, the peasants have had to fall
back on cattle-rearing, and dairy-farming. But this hardly
suffices for their necessities, and many of the men turn into
hawkers, and almost all migrate at the time of the vintage to
the Bordelais and to Languedoc. Whether it be the bear
association, or the migratory habits of the fathers of the household,
has given a rudeness and lack of self-respect to the
children cannot be said, but nowhere in the Pyrenees does
mendicity prevail with such persistency and effrontery as in
the valleys of the Couserans. The legend prevails in the
plain that when Christ was walking over the earth with
S. Peter He found these valleys unpopulated; so He took clay
and moulded it into a man, and set the figure on its feet
before Him, and breathed into it the breath of life; whereupon
instantly the New Adam held out its hands and cried,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“Un p’tit sou, siou plaît, m’ssius!” Begging has ever since
been the predominant and all-prevailing instinct of the upper
region of the Couserans.</p>

<p>The population here as elsewhere in the mountains is
dwindling owing to emigration, mainly to South America,
especially to the Argentine Republic. This is largely due
to the peasant seeing the comfort and comparative wealth
of his brother peasant in the plain, the proprietor of vineyard
and olive-yard, and of mulberry trees that feed silkworms.
He returns to his Alpine pastures sulky and dissatisfied with
his condition. He is unwilling to change his native, deeply-rooted
customs of farming, that are unscientific and wasteful,
incapable maybe of realizing that he might do better if he
adopted newer methods.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nevertheless,” says M. Ardouin-Dumazet, “he might lead
a better existence if he could be brought to limit the quantity
of his cattle to that number which he could rear suitably; if
he would consent to make a practical use of the milk of his
flocks. But everywhere in Ariège one finds every little
property support three times as many beasts as the soil can
well sustain; the result is lean cattle, giving poor meat and
milk, giving consequently but an insufficient return of revenue.</p>

<p>“However, nowhere has the problem of the renovation of
the pastures and the animals that overrun it been more studied
and theoretically resolved. The Board of Forestry has shown
by example how that the extent of meadowland and the quality
of the grass might be largely extended. But everywhere it
encounters invincible routine.</p>

<p>“Every hamlet, every farm has its stables, in which during
the winter the beasts are crowded in conditions of hygiene
absolutely deplorable. Air, light, litter are wanting; the
fodder is measured out sparingly. If the winter be long there
is dearth, for the number of beasts is out of all proportion to
the resources of the forage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“So soon as the weather becomes mild, at once the animals
are despatched to the pastures or the waste lands; too numerous
for the space, they ruin the turf and trample up the soil.
The high pastures are squandered, and, above all, are not kept
up. Juniper and rhododendrons invade them without the
mountaineers concerning themselves about it. The agents of
the Forestry have shown them how to get rid of these shrubs
by eradication and burning, and how to make the ashes
fertilize the meadows; they have shown them how by irrigation
to enhance the quantity and quality of the herbage.
This has been seen, understood, but not followed. Channels
for irrigation have been made by the foresters and abandoned.
The watering places for the cattle are choked. The paths
rendering access to the mountain pastures are not kept up.
The carelessness of the herdsmen surpasses all that could be
imagined. It makes one despair.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And the only remedy for their poverty that they can conceive
is to turn their children out into the roads to beg for
sous.</p>

<p>A watering-place at Aulus is coming into fashion. It is
reached from S. Girons by a good road, and is distant from
it thirty-three kilometres; Aulus lies high up in the valley of
the Garbet.</p>

<p>On leaving S. Girons&mdash;about which I say nothing, as concerning
it nothing can be said&mdash;the factory of La Moulasse
is passed, where cigarette papers are manufactured in large
quantities. The man who started making them was named
Jean Bardon, and he put his initials on the little books of
cigarette papers, with a lozenge between, thus J.◊.B. This
was read as Job, and such papers acquired the name and
became famous as Job’s cigarette papers. The name has
been accepted on the spot, and the sources of the Moulasse
that feeds the factory are now called “les sources de Job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Vic, now a little village of 150 inhabitants, was once a
Roman station, and remained of sufficient consequence in
the Middle Ages to give to S. Girons the name of Bourg-sous-Vic.
It has a little church with three Romanesque apses,
and a ceiling of the sixteenth century with paintings in squares.
Beside the church is a Sully elm. Such elms were planted
throughout the country as token of rejoicing in 1593, when
Henry IV abjured Calvinism and joined the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Oust also speaks of the Roman occupation; the name is
derived from Augusta. At Oust the road leaves the valley
of the Salat to ascend its tributary vale of the Garbet; to
the south snowy crests appear and the cascade of Arse
comes in view. The Nine Springs is passed, supposed to
have an underground course from the marshy lake of Lhers,
at a distance of four miles. Usually it gives but little water;
but after a storm the source bursts forth suddenly with
violence and pours down in cascade over the rocks.</p>

<p>Aulus lies in an extremely agreeable situation, surrounded
by well-wooded mountains, above which soar snowy peaks.
The place was well known to the Romans, who worked there
the mines of silver-lead. As a watering-place it is furnished
with a casino, a park, and theatre in which every evening
during the season comedies and farces are performed; and
in the park a band plays twice a day. Old Aulus lay on the
farther side of the river, but the new site is better exposed to
the sun. Aulus lies in a cul-de-sac; no road goes farther&mdash;at
least none that can be utilized by a carriage. Some little
mountain tarns are objects of a visit by those who spend a
few days at Aulus, ascending to them on the backs of mules.
The largest of these lie in the valleys scooped out of the mass
of the Pic de Bassiès, 8165 feet.</p>

<p>But it must be allowed that in this portion of the chain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the Pyrenees go in for breadth rather than height. In fact,
in Ariège they become somewhat dishevelled, unwind, and
straggle into separate threads. The loftiest ridge is that
along which runs the frontier; the second is that which starts
from the Pic de Camporeile, and is called the Montagne de
Tabe, attaining in the Pic de Campzas only to 7670 feet.
The third chain is the limestone Planturel that reaches its
supreme elevation in the Montagne de Roquefixade, 3010 feet.
This is a curious ridge running parallel with the Pyrenees,
very regular, but cut through in several places, and ending
at Foix. Those who desire to visit a portion of the
Pyrenees less in resort than the mountains of the Haute
Garonne and the Hautes Pyrénées will not fail to find in this
section many delightful sites.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> county of Foix, now constituting the major portion
of the department of Ariège, is and always was in Languedoc.
The Couserans was, however, ever regarded as forming
a part of Gascony. The ridge between the Volp and the
Salat separates two hydrographic basins and two provinces.
Geographically the department of Ariège belongs nevertheless
to the basin of the Garonne; all its streams, with the exception
of a few at the extreme east, flow into that great artery,
and finally discharge into the Atlantic. Linguistically only
the Couserans is Gascon; yet Foix from an early date was
united to Béarn and Bigorre.</p>

<p>Of the earliest history of the counts of Foix we know very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
little. Roger Bernard, who died in 1188, was an excellent
prince. His son, Raymond Roger, lived in difficult times,
and was involved in the troubles arising out of the attempt
of Pope Innocent III to stamp out the heresy of the
Albigenses.</p>

<p>To understand the spread of this heresy and the Crusade
which devastated these fair lands in the South, a few words
must be said.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Christianity had not struck
deep roots in Languedoc. The clergy had acquired but a
smattering of Latin, and a meagre knowledge of doctrine in
the monastic schools. They entered on their cures not much
raised above their parishioners in culture, and in morals not
infrequently sank below their level. Enforced clerical celibacy
was evaded, but this evasion left a scar on the conscience.
Bishoprics and abbacies were the provision of cadets of noble
houses, whether religiously or morally qualified was of no
account.</p>

<p>In what is now the department of Ariège, no bigger than
an ordinarily sized English county, there were three episcopal
sees&mdash;S. Lizier, Pamiers, and Mirepoix&mdash;and many abbeys.</p>

<p>A persecution of the Manichees in the Byzantine Empire
sent a stream of refugees into Lombardy, Provence, and Languedoc,
and these heretics speedily acquired a strong hold on
the popular imagination. The Church had done so little to
awaken the spiritual life in the souls of men, that instinctively,
but blindly, they turned to welcome such as promised something
better.</p>

<p>The Cathari, i.e. Puritans, as they called themselves, offered
a very simple creed and easy conditions of salvation. The
fundamental principle of this religion was a Dualism of Good
and Evil principles, equally matched; the Evil Principle, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
author of the visible Creation; the Good Principle, the author
of the invisible, the Spiritual world. The opposition of matter
and spirit formed the basis of their moral system. All that
pertained to the body, all its functions, its needs, its passions,
were of the Evil One; all the aspirations of the soul emanated
from the Good Principle. To the people of Provence and
Languedoc and Gascony the Cathari seemed to be inoffensive,
self-denying enthusiasts. These had their high-priests&mdash;the
“Perfect” or “Very Elect”&mdash;and it was the function of
these men to “console” the believers; but the sacrament of
Consolation was never administered till it was supposed that
a believer was on his death-bed, for this reason, that after it
had been administered the recipient might not touch food
under pain of committing the unpardonable sin. If there
should appear signs of convalescence after the performance of
the rite, the person consoled was bled to death, or given
pounded glass to swallow.</p>

<p>This new Manichæism offered to the people of the South just
what they wanted. They had set before them a class of
enthusiasts, the Very Elect, who led austere lives; but they
themselves were not required to adopt a life of abstinence,
even of self-restraint, for at death free justification was
offered them by a simple formula. Moreover, the theological
system of the Cathari was simplicity itself.</p>

<p>The whole of the South was infected. A council, held at
Albi in 1176, condemned the heresy, and thenceforth the
heretics were called Albigenses.</p>

<p>The princes, notably the counts of Toulouse and of Foix,
did not interfere. The Albigenses were inoffensive people. If
they held odd opinions, that was their own affair, with which
their feudal lords were not concerned to meddle.</p>

<p>But the Court of Rome thought otherwise. The flow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
contributions into its treasury from the rich South dwindled
to nothing. What to the Pope was even more serious was
that his authority was openly flouted.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent&mdash;is there not bitter satire in the name&mdash;in
1203 sent a legate into the southern provinces, Peter of Castelnau
by name. This man visited Toulouse, but his efforts
there to confute the heresy failed completely. Hopeless of
success and mortified in his vanity Peter appealed to Pope
Innocent to adopt drastic measures, and Innocent bade him
require Raymond, Count of Toulouse, to suppress Albigensianism
throughout his dominions by fire and sword. He was
ordered, on pain of excommunication, to become the inquisitor
and executioner of his subjects. At the same time he
deposed Raymond, Bishop of Toulouse, an amiable, liberal-minded
man, and put in his place the firebrand Foulques, who
had been a troubadour, and notorious for his licentious verses.</p>

<p>Raymond VI of Toulouse promptly refused to do what was
required of him, whereupon Innocent, in 1207, pronounced
his excommunication.</p>

<p>Possibly the Count may have let slip some expression of
disgust at the conduct of the papal legate, and a wish to be
well rid of him, as did Henry II with reference to Becket.
The result was the same; a knight killed Peter of Castelnau
in 1208 as he was crossing the Rhone. This filled up the
measure of Innocent’s wrath. He hurled the most dreadful
imprecations against the Count, and loudly summoned all
Christendom to a war of extermination against the Albigenses.
“Anathema to the Count of Toulouse! Remission of all sins
to such as arm against these pestilential Provincials. Go forward,
soldiers of Christ! May the heretics perish out of the
land, and let colonies of Christians be established in their
room!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Dukes and bishops, counts and viscounts, flew to the standard
of the Cross, eager to glut themselves on the spoil of the
South, so rich with merchandise, and at the same time to gain
eternal salvation by violation and murder. Three armies invaded
the South under the supreme command of a needy
northern knight, Simon de Montfort.</p>

<p>The Pope was as subtle as he was remorseless. In order to
weaken the opposition in the South he had entered into negociation
with Raymond of Toulouse, and had deluded him into
expectations of pardon, till the Crusaders were on him. They
began with Béziers, although the viscount was known to be
a Catholic. The city was taken and the inhabitants massacred.
The Abbot of Citeaux, the legate, wrote regretfully to
Innocent that he could only answer for having cut the throats
of twenty thousand.</p>

<p>Then the papal host marched to Cascassonne, where they
hung fifty prisoners, and burned four hundred Albigenses
alive.</p>

<p>Raymond was now offered pardon if he would dismiss his
soldiers, level his castles and the walls of his towns, give the
Inquisition a free hand in his domains, and make every householder
pay a tax of four deniers to the papal treasury. The
Count indignantly refused, and the legate again sounded the
attack. Raymond was defeated at Castelnaudary, and compelled
to fly to Aragon. The conquerors seized on his territory,
which the needy knights of the north parcelled out
among themselves; and they diverted themselves in hunting
out the heretics and burning them.</p>

<p>Urged on by his kinsman, the Count of Toulouse, Peter II,
King of Aragon, passed the Pyrenees with an army, and was
at once joined by the Count of Foix and many other nobles.
A battle was fought at Muret in 1213, in which the King was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
killed, the army routed, and the nobles of Languedoc dispersed.
This sealed the fate of the country. The Council of
the Lateran, held two years later, ratified the deposition of
Raymond, who, along with the counts of Foix and Cominges,
had appeared before the Council, with bitter complaints in
their mouths of the way in which their subjects had been
slaughtered wholesale and the country laid waste. At once
up sprang Foulques, Bishop of Toulouse. “Foix,” said he,
“swarms with heretics. The sister of the Count intercepted
and cut to pieces six thousand Germans, Crusaders, on their
way to join the legate.”</p>

<p>“Soldiers of the Cross!” retorted the Count of Foix fearlessly.
“They were mere robbers, committing every possible
outrage in the country.”</p>

<p>Then the Baron de Vilamour rose, and in a cold voice gave
a detailed account of the horrors, the rapes, the murders, the
ravages committed by the Soldiers of the Cross, those sent
forth by the Holy See with assurance of gaining Heaven thereby.
As he spoke Innocent’s head sank on his breast, and he
heaved a sigh; some sense of shame stole into his heart. He
went to meet his account in 1216, and was succeeded by
Honorius III.</p>

<p>Toulouse, the whole South, writhed under the despotism of
Simon de Montfort, and called back its exiled count. A new
Crusade was preached. Remission of sins was offered to all
who would glean what the first locust swarm had left, and massacre
such as had been spared. Excommunication was again
launched against the Count of Toulouse and the Count of Foix.
In an attack on Toulouse Simon de Montfort was killed, and
the command was taken by Prince Louis of France. Before
this vast army the cities of Languedoc opened their gates.
Count Raymond and he of Foix bowed to the storm. Louis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
died of exhaustion on his return, after having secured the
submission of almost the whole land.</p>

<p>Count Roger Bernard of Foix was excommunicated in 1228,
and was forced to subscribe to the most degrading terms.
The truce lasted eight years. In 1237 he was summoned to
appear and answer for his orthodoxy before the papal Inquisitors
quartered in his own domains, and holding their court in
his own castle. Because he refused he was again excommunicated.
He was compelled to submit in 1240, and died
in the ensuing year.</p>

<p>The horrors of the extirpation of heresy continued till
1244, when the last of the strongholds of the Albigenses was
taken, and two hundred of them were burnt alive without
a trial.</p>

<p>After that all trace of them gradually disappears.</p>

<p>Bernard Roger III (1265) married Margaret de Moncada,
second daughter of Gaston de Béarn, and as she was heiress,
he annexed her territories, and thenceforth the history of
Foix is merged in that of Béarn.</p>

<p>Foix, in local patois <i>Fouch</i>, is situated at the junction of
the Arget with the Ariège, and where, most conveniently for
military purposes, a rock shoots up, abrupt and bold, inviting
the mediæval noble to plant his castle on the summit. The
castle never was a palace like that of Pau; it never was anything
but a stronghold. When the counts became lords of
Béarn they abandoned their ancient nest, which if secure was
inconvenient, and betook themselves to their own creations at
Mazères, Orthez, and Pau. The town occupies a triangle
where the two rivers already mentioned unite. It is a dull
place, its sole feature being the castle, like a very plain man
with a very prominent nose. That it should be capital of the
department is due to association, not to size, for Pamiers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
where was a cathedral, exceeds it in population. It has a
theatre, in which but rarely a performance is given; a public
library, open for a few hours one day in the week, into which
an occasional reader saunters; baths, better known externally
than within; an abattoir, where oxen past work are
slaughtered, for consumption by those of the inhabitants who
have digestions that could dissolve leather; a promenade
which lacks promenaders; a vast prefecture, in which the
prefect is dying daily of ennui. The Hotel des Gouverneurs
has become Palais de Justice&mdash;“un édifice banal, malgré ce
nom grandiloquent.”</p>

<p>The rock of Foix is 178 feet above the river, and is surmounted
by three noble towers that served successively as
keeps. In the donjons the Inquisition had their court, their
trials, and sentences, and the Count had to resign his castle
to them in pledge of submission to the judgment of the
Holy See. The loftiest of the towers is cylindrical, and is
attributed to Gaston Phœbus, but apparently it dates from
the fifteenth century. Between the noble towers appear the
mean buildings of a prison, in which those who are confined
yawn their time away. Below the rock, near the river, at the
apex of the triangle, is the church of S. Volusinian, of the
fourteenth century, and, like most of the great churches in
this portion of the south of France, consists of a nave without
aisles. The choir is surrounded by radiating chapels.</p>

<p>Volusinian was Bishop of Tours, a native of Auvergne.
When Alaric, King of the Goths, invaded Gaul he carried
Volusinian away with him south, and as he proved to be uncompromising
in his adherence to the Creed of Nicæa, had
him executed at Foix. His festival is on 11 February, and
he suffered in 491. Foix has no manufactures, no trade&mdash;hardly
an expectant <i>commis voyageur</i> visits it; but I am in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
error. It has perpetrated a joke, a miserable pun&mdash;Foix produces
<i>patés de foie gras</i>.</p>

<p>Were there but coal-mines near at hand Foix would revive,
for the whole county is full of iron ore. Foix bleeds iron
from its veins, but the ferruginous springs run away into the
river. The stars in their courses fight against Foix; the
valley of the Arget was full of nailmakers at one time&mdash;in 1835
there were forty-seven forges. Now their fires are put out:
machine-made nails have killed the hand-made nails. Those
made in the Barguillère, the valley of the Arget, were for
horseshoes, and the makers dubbed themselves <i>chevaliers</i>.
The extinction of the little forges has led to depopulation;
between 1891 and 1901 there was a loss of 27,092 inhabitants
in that district.</p>

<p>To the north of the town rises a steep hill, on the summit of
which is the hermitage of S. Sauveur, but the last hermit has
departed this life; his occupation also is gone, and he has no
successor. The Administration has put an end to the hermits.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Foix is the Grotto de l’Herme, that
has yielded notable finds of prehistoric man. But the main
curiosity is the Mas d’Azil, where the river Arize has bored
its way through the limestone barrier of the Planturel. This
long chain opposed a passage northwards to the river descending
from the mountains to the south. The Arize discovered
a fault in the barrier and pierced it, forming a noble arch
250 feet high. Beside it is an artificial gallery bored for the
passage of the road. The length of the tunnel is 1250 feet.
The road follows the right bank of the Arize, separated from
it by a wall of rock. The river descends into the gallery, the
average width of which is ninety-five feet, breaking over
masses of rock that have fallen from the roof. Above the left
bank, under the huge vault, rises a natural column, called the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Monk. Farther on in the gallery, a pillar thirty feet in
diameter sustaining the roof. There are lateral galleries, at a
higher elevation, that have yielded evidence of human occupation.
The guano produced by the innumerable bats that
inhabit the cave actually forms an article of commerce.</p>

<p>The opening to the north, through which the river effects
its escape, is less striking in appearance than that where it
makes its plunge underground.</p>

<p>The road from Foix to Ax leads up the river that gives its
name to the department, and penetrates deep into the recesses
of the mountains.</p>

<p>The first town reached is Tarascon, prettily situated at
the junction of the Vicdessos with the Ariège, about a conical
hill surmounted by a round tower, which is all that remains
of a castle that was blown up by order of Richelieu. The
great cardinal thought that the best means of maiming the
independence of the nobles, petty barons, and seigneurs, was
to destroy their nests. It was he, not the Revolutionists,
who made the worst havoc among the stately châteaux of
France. He went so far even as to insist on the pepper-castor
roofed round towers at the angles of every small
squire’s mansion being lowered a story to the level of the eaves
of the main roof. Tarascon on Ariège is a busier place than
sleepy Tarascon on Rhone, that was drawn out of its obscurity
by the mythical Tastarin. It is the great centre of activity
to the country, “a land whose stones are iron.” Formerly
it was more prosperous than it is to-day. But the population
remains stationary, which in the midst of a universal shrinkage
may be reckoned as good. The town is divided into two
parts. Old Tarascon clusters about the decayed castle.
New Tarascon forms the faubourg Sainte Quitterie, where
there is a ferruginous spring bearing the name of the saint,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
and supposed miraculously to cure insanity. The wonder in
this part of the mountains is to find any springs that do not
run red. Quiteria, who has given virtue to this spring, is
a person of problematical existence. Once upon a time&mdash;the
Bollandists even know not when&mdash;there lived a King
Katillas and his wife Calsia, who inhabited doubtlessly a
Château en Espagne. Queen Calsia gave birth to nine
daughters at once, and being afraid what the King would say,
gave them to the nurse with orders to drown them like puppies.
But the nurse took them to her home, and reared all in the
Christian faith. In time of persecution the nine damsels
dispersed, but were caught and offered the alternative of
marriage or death. They accepted the latter. One of them,
named Wilgefortis, when pestered by a princely suitor,
prayed, and lo! out sprouted a thick beard and moustache.
She was crucified. Quiteria’s head was struck off with a
sword. But unwilling to be less of an oddity than her sister,
after death she developed into three entire bodies. One
became the perquisite of the Portuguese, another of the
Spaniards, and the Gascons got hold of the third, and buried
it at Aire. I have little doubt that, when a man reputed
insane was brought to Quiteria’s well and made to drink
eight tumblers full of the red water, he remonstrated, and
vowed that he was well; whereupon his relations cried
out, “A miracle! He has spoken sensibly. Thanks be to
Quiteria.”</p>

<p>To Tarascon comes the iron ore from the mines in the
Vicdessos valley in carts and tumbrils, and is there smelted.
There are here also quarries of gypsum for the manufacture
of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p>To the south of the town is the church of Notre Dame de
Sabart, so-called from Sabarthès, the name of the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
region formed by the Valley of Vicdessos and of the Ariège
as far as Les Cabannes. The church is Romanesque, and
there are remains of an abbey founded for an order of military
knights, founded, it is said, by Charlemagne, as a protection
of the population and the valuable iron-mines. This is a resort
of pilgrims on 8 May and 15 September, when fairs are held
at Tarascon, and business, pleasure, and devotion can be
harmoniously combined. The Valley of Vicdessos is, and has
been from time immemorial, the great seat of iron-mining in
the Pyrenees. The ore is nearly pure, and lies in veins and
pockets in the limestone of the mountains of Rance, and the
deposits form bands alternating with the calcareous rock
through a height of over 1800 feet.</p>

<p>The working of the mines is the privilege of the inhabitants
of Sem, Goulier, and Olbier, and natives of Vicdessos and other
villages about can only be admitted to this privilege by marrying
a girl of one of the three named. Otherwise they can be
employed only as wagoners drawing the ore to Tarascon.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of these mines is in a charter of the
Count of Foix in 1293. For centuries the counts found the
utmost difficulty in levying a toll on the iron carried out of
the valley; the miners exercised their ingenuity in evading
it, and overriding all the restrictions hampering their industry.
Unhappily, for many hundred years the mining was not
carried on by companies, but by individuals who grubbed
where they would and carried on the works in the most
wasteful manner. Now the veins of ore are giving out; but
the men who have exclusive rights to the mines refuse
obstinately and ignorantly to admit of new methods in the
extraction of the ore, and disapprove of co-operation. The
ancient medieval corporations have survived at Sem, with
their traditional rites and formulas. The law on mines of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
1893 has somewhat modified some of the restrictions and
extended the rights of mining. But the men are stolidly
opposed to improvement; they retain the prejudices of their
fathers. They have cut down the trees, and the mountain
torrents now devastate their little fields and carry away the
roads. The State has vainly endeavoured to replant, and
by so doing diminish the range of the ravages caused by goats
and sheep. The output of the mines dwindles and the impoverishment
of the villagers increases. From Usat may
be visited the cavern of Lombrive, only an hour’s walk from
the baths of Usat. The last stronghold of the unfortunate
Albigenses was the Castle of Montségur, in the valley of the
Lasset, that flows into the Hers. Buried among the mountains,
hidden from most eyes, in an apparently inaccessible position,
they hoped to be forgotten and to remain in security. But
they were scented and tracked by the bloodhounds of the
Papacy, and the army of the Crusaders, reluctantly led by
Raymond VII of Toulouse, constrained by Innocent VI, who
carried on the remorseless policy of Innocent III, and as the
sole means of obtaining forgiveness for himself, surrounded it in
1244. The castle stands on and amidst tremendous precipices,
and is commanded by the Pic S. Barthélemy. The Albigensian
chiefs held out for long, and repulsed several assaults.
Then, seeing that their provisions were failing, and that they
could not much longer maintain their position, they dispatched
four of their number to carry away their treasures to some
place of security. These four men crossed the mountain
spurs, and hid the treasure in one of the many caverns that
open in the cliffs above Usat, but where has not yet been
discovered.</p>

<p>On 14 March Montségur was taken, and over two hundred
heretics found in it were thrown alive into a huge bonfire that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
had been erected, and burnt alive to satisfy the implacable
vengeance of the Papacy. After that the horde of Crusaders
went to Tarascon to search the valleys for more on whom to
glut their rage. All the Albigenses of the country round had
fled to the caves; they were hunted out and massacred.
Nevertheless, all had not been exterminated. In 1325, when
John XXII was reigning in Avignon, a fresh pursuit of the
heretics was instituted. It was reported that the Albigenses
employed the cave of Lombrive as their cathedral. The
armies of the Papacy assembled anew and filled the valley.
From five to six hundred of the unfortunate heretics&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;took refuge in the cavern that runs
deep into the heart of the mountain. It has been explored
for a distance of three miles. To save themselves the trouble
and risk of pursuing the Albigenses in darkness through the
winding recesses of the cave, the entrance was walled up,
and the miserable wretches were all left to perish there of
starvation in abysmal night. Their bones still lie scattered
about the pit. The treasures of the Albigenses, supposed to
have been hidden there, have never been recovered; but the
true treasure, for which they fought and for which they died,
the emancipation of the human soul from the fetters of
slavery in which it had been bound by Rome, has been won
by nearly all Europe.</p>

<p>Les Cabannes lies in a beautiful basin formed by the
junction of the Aston with the Ariège. From hence the
lateral valley branches off that formed the seigneuries of the
Lordadais. In it is planted one of the mightiest fortresses
of the counts of Foix, perched on a rock, and commanding
a most picturesque site. It was blown up in 1632, by order
of Louis XIII, but still retains portions of four concentric
oval-enclosing walls, and a square keep. From the castle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
can be viewed the entire mass of the Tabe; its culminating
point, the Pic S. Barthélemy, shoots up superbly to the
height of 7060 feet. At Vernaux is a Romanesque church.
This place has given its name to the talc that is found in
quarries near by, situated at a great elevation, some 6600 feet
above the sea, and where the workmen can be employed only
from 1 May to 15 November. The bed of talc is about
120 feet thick, and extends for a length of 1500 feet, and is
sent down to the station of Luzenac by a wire rope.</p>

<p>Ax-les-Thermes is planted at the junction of the Oriège
and the Ariège. About it rise many bold crags; on the
summit of one is Castel Maü, supposed to have been a Moorish
fortress. Another supports a huge statue of the Virgin.
The whole valley has been studded with castles, of which
now only the ruins remain. In troubled times, when warfare
was incessant between the counts of Foix and the counts of
Urgel, or between them and the Crusaders, every country
gentleman was obliged to pitch his house on the top of a rock,
and give it the character of a stronghold. Some of these are
so small that they could not have accommodated more than
a little garrison; and the seigneurs must have lived cramped
and uneasy in them. Probably they had their houses in
the valley, and only retreated to these castles when the clash
of arms sounded. It is a pity that some of these picturesque
ruins should not be restored. On the Dordogne, the Lot,
and the Vezère, some rich wine merchant of Bordeaux buys up
a castle, and makes it habitable in the midst of a park. When
in residence there M. Blom of Bordeaux blossoms out into
le Comte de Montréal, and M. Dois into le Marquis de Beausejour.
In England we have to pay heavy fees when we
acquire a title; it is not so in France. There a man dubs
himself baron, or count, or marquis. As to the armorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
bearings that they assume&mdash;“Ma foi!” exclaimed a painter,
looking at the heraldic shield over one of these châteaux,
“what imaginations these <i>nouveaux riches</i> possess!”</p>

<p>Ax (Aquæ) was probably a Roman thermal station. The
place was frequented in the Middle Ages, when the Hôtel
Dieu was founded (in 1260) for the reception of patients.
Even before that, in 1200, a bath for lepers was constructed
here. The Hôtel Dieu owes its origin to King Louis IX, who
had it constructed for the use of Crusaders who had contracted
leprosy in Palestine and Egypt. But it was not till
the beginning of the eighteenth century that Ax was much
frequented. Now it receives about ten thousand visitors in
the year, seeking healing in its water. The springs are so
numerous, and so thickly strewn, that the town seems as
though erected over the rose of a fountain of thermal waters.</p>

<p>From Ax Andorra may be reached by the Port de Saldeu.
Andorra is the sole remaining independent republic in the
Pyrenees. It has a legendary origin. In 805 Louis “le
Débonnaire” was on his way to besiege Urgel, and the
Andorrans took up arms and materially aided him. In
recognition of their services Louis conferred on them a
charter that accorded to them the rights of self-government.
Later, when Emperor, he conceded to the Bishop of Urgel
half the tithe of the six parishes in the valley, as well as half
his right of suzerainty over the diminutive republic. Actually
Andorra formed a lordship in the county of Urgel, and it was
the counts of that place who granted rights over it to the
bishops of the see of Urgel. Later on the seigneural rights
passed to the counts of Foix. Counts and bishops wrangled
over their respective claims, till in 1278 the feud was settled
by a convention that accorded to the republic the privileges
that it still enjoys&mdash;local autonomy under the double suzerainty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
of the bishops of Urgel and the counts of Foix, to whom
has succeeded the French Government. The Andorrans
pay a tribute to France annually of 950 francs, and to the
Bishop of Urgel 450 francs.</p>

<p>This duodecimo republic has an area of 175 square miles,
and a population of six thousand. It is governed by a council
of twenty-four, elected by the householders, and two provosts&mdash;one
nominated by the French Government, the other
by the Bishop of Urgel, exercising in common judicial powers.
These provosts are theoretically the captains of the Andorran
militia, which is composed of all the heads of houses. Of
the twenty-four councillors, elected every four years, one half
are renewable every two years. The republic consists of
three valleys, surrounded by mountains on every side save
where in the south the River Embaline issues and flows down
to Urgel. The land is fertile for the altitude at which the
basin lies, but its principal products are timber and iron, and
its chief industry is smuggling. Some years ago a proposal
was made to the little republic to convert it into a monster
gambling hell. This was after the closing of the house at
Homburg; but although the sum offered was tempting, the
Andorrans had the good sense to refuse the offer, which
accordingly was then made to the Prince of Monaco, and by
him seized.</p>

<p>The capital is a dirty, ill-built village; the principal buildings
in it are a Romanesque church and the palace, a fortified
structure of the fifteenth century, which serves as the seat
of government, school, Palais de Justice, and prison. On the
ground-floor are stables for the horses of the councillors.</p>

<p>In the council hall is a great oak chest containing the
archives, and fastened by six locks, the key to each being
retained by each of the six parishes. The town or village<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
has a dismal look, the houses being constructed of slate and
schist rock.</p>

<p>The original capital was at S. Julien de Loria, where a cross
marks the site.</p>

<p>On the heights are the remains of an old Moorish castle,
called Carol, a name derived from Charles the Great, who is
supposed to have expelled the infidel. The name of Andorra
is supposed to be taken from the Arabic <i>aldarra</i>, “a place
thick with trees.” Mr. Ford <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The hills around the rich alluvial basin of Andorra abound
in pine forests, which afford fuel; nothing can be prettier than
the distant views of the villages, embosomed in woods; at
Mont Melous are three lakes enclosed by lofty and fantastic
walls of rock.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A rough road leads from Andorra to Seo de Urgel, a distance
of sixteen miles. This is a quaint old Spanish town with an
interesting cathedral of the eleventh century, and a cloister
of considerable beauty. The town is commanded by the
citadel on the height Las Horcas, “The Gallows,” where the
Bishop of Urgel, who was a sovereign prince, hung miscreants.</p>

<p>Urgel was the headquarters of a Carlist insurrection in 1827.
This was put down by an adventurer of French origin; none
knew his real name, and what had been his position in life,
before he turned up and offered his services to Ferdinand VII
and dubbed himself the Count of Spain. He served the
King well, was absolutely without scruples, and remorselessly
cruel. He was made by Ferdinand Governor of Catalonia.
But, on the death of his patron in 1833, he passed over to
Don Carlos, and fought under him for the very cause which
a few years previously he had put down. But his former
cruelties were not forgotten. He made his headquarters at
Urgel. The Junta of the Carlists was summoned to meet at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Aira on 26 October, 1839, and the Count went to attend it.
He was received with expressions of pleasure and devotion by
his aide-de-camp, Mariano Orteu, who engaged him in conversation,
whilst the <i>curé</i>, Ferres, levelled a pistol at him,
fired, and wounded him.</p>

<p>The Count fell, and pleaded for a drink of water. This
was refused. He was then mounted on a mule, his feet bound
together under the belly, and he was conducted from place to
place, exposed to the insults and derision of the people, till
1 November, when he found himself at Ceselles; there, with
cruel irony his former friend Orteu informed the unfortunate
man that he was to be speedily “sent to his own place.”
Then he deliberately shot him, and the rest of the company
fell on him and hacked him to pieces with their long
knives.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> Ax-les-Thermes a good carriage road crosses the
Col de Puy Morens to the Cerdagne and to Puygcerda
in Spanish territory. It passes through most bald and weariful
uplands, under the Pic de Carlitte, which is the highest
point of the watershed between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
The height of this peak is 9580 feet, and its flanks
are starred with lakes, many of which are frozen through a
great part of the year, more than are found in any other
part of the Pyrenees. The Etang de Lanous is three kilometres
long and from 500 to 600 yards across, pinched in the
middle so as to form two basins. It is covered with ice for
about nine months. It swarms with red-fleshed <i>Salmo
alpinus</i>, which is excellent eating.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A frame of lofty mountains, reaching above 7500 feet
surrounds this lake. Behind this barrier are other sheets of
water; the most extensive lie on the north side, in the department
of Ariège. Among these is the Etang d’En-Beys, whence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
issues the Oriège; the Etangs of Peyrisse from which the water
descends in a series of cascades to form the large and beautiful
Lake of Naguilles, a reservoir to be utilized some day for the
irrigation of the plain of Pamiers, and any number of others
lying asleep at the bottom of valleys, in which, with the exception
of a few shepherds, no other face is seen.”</p></blockquote>

<p>All this portion of the chain is almost barren and sad. The
road leads through a dreary country, where the snow lies long,
and the scanty grass is burnt with the frozen streams, and
heaped with granitic blocks thrown up by moraines of glaciers
that no longer exist. A few miserable villages are passed till
the ruins are reached of the Castle of Carol, of which two
towers remain. This was at one time the chief place of the
valley, and it maintained independence in the midst of the
county of Cerdagne.</p>

<p>At Quès the river of Carol, flowing south, is arrested by a
barrier of rocks, formed to serve for irrigation by means of
a canal, as far as Puygcerda. It is, perhaps, the earliest
recorded instance, at least in medieval times, of such an
economic undertaking. This canal was constructed in 1318,
by virtue of a charter of Sanchez, King of Majorca. It was so
well constructed that it serves its purpose admirably to the
present day, fertilizing the fields below it, whereas above the
life-giving stream the mountain side is barren. When the
Treaty of the Pyrenees was drawn in 1659 it was stipulated
that this barrier and the canal from it, though on territory
ceded to France, should be maintained in good order.</p>

<p>The Cerdagne became an independent state soon after the
Moorish invasion of 731. It was governed by a Berber chief,
Munuza by name, who threw in his lot with the Franks
against the Yemenite Arabs of the South, and even married
a daughter of Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine. But he was killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
near Puygcerda; his head was salted, and sent to the Caliph
of Damascus.</p>

<p>About 928 Miro, Count of Barcelona, gave Cerdagne to his
son Oliba Cabréta, and it was ruled by its own counts till 1117,
when the last died childless, and then it was reannexed to the
county of Barcelona, and later went to Aragon. Finally, by
the peace of 1659, it was divided, much to the indignation of
the inhabitants, who protested ineffectually&mdash;half went to
France, and half remained to Spain. France thrust her frontier
down the Spanish slope of the mountains, taking in the
rivers that flow south to feed the Ebro, just as Spain carried
her frontier beyond the highest crests of the range to include
the Val d’Aran and the head waters of the Garonne. But
this acquisition on the part of France was not as unreasonable
as it would seem, for the object was to secure communication
between Foix and the Conflant and Valespir valleys that
opened unto the plain of Roussillon, which had also become
incorporated into the kingdom of France.</p>

<p>There is, however, a curious little <i>enclave</i> of twelve square
kilometres, about the town of Llivia, completely surrounded
by French territory, that remains Spanish. The explanation
of this anomaly is as follows: At the Peace of the Pyrenees
Spain agreed to surrender to France thirty-three villages in
Cerdagne. But Llivia haughtily protested that she was not
a village, but a town, once a city with a bishop of her own,
consequently did not come within the terms of the agreement.
This was admitted, and Llivia remains Spanish, much to the
inconvenience of the custom-house officers, who have to maintain
a cordon of douaniers about the petty territory. Now
Llivia, that possesses 330 inhabitants, regrets the past. Spain
exacts of her taxes to the amount of 30,000 francs, and gives
her nothing in return&mdash;neither a post office, nor telegraph,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
nor roads. The post office has to be kept up by the citizens,
so also the roads till they reach the frontier. Llivia was a
Roman town founded in honour of the wife of Augustus, and
some remains of the Roman walls exist. It is a poor, decayed
place. A castle in ruins occupies the highest point of the hill
on which it is built; the large church is planted on a terrace
above the cold, slated roofs of the sordid houses and narrow
streets of the town.</p>

<p>Cerdagne is the country of the Ceretani of Pliny, and the
same people occupied the Valespir, and have left their name
in the town of Ceret. The race was not Iberic, but purely
Celtic, and their name is the same as that given to Ceretica,
or Ceredigion, Cardigan in Wales.</p>

<p>Whilst Llivia decays malodorously under Spanish neglect,
a little hamlet on French soil, Bourg-Madame, is growing into
vigorous and fresh life. Not many years ago it was nothing
but a cluster of a couple of taverns and a station of the customs,
and it was called Guinguettes d’Hix. But the situation
favoured it, standing on the frontier at the point where the
high road from Barcelona is linked on to a network of French
main roads. Moreover, Barcelona derives much of its butter
and cheese from the French Cerdagne, and the trade consequently
passes through the place. In 1815 the Duke of
Angoulême entered France by this door on the frontier, and
the inhabitants obtained from him leave to alter the name of
the growing town to Bourg-Madame.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees of this part of the chain is one of the most
barren mountain systems in Europe. The passes into Spain
are mere notches cut to a depth of 600 to 900 feet in the ridge,
that rises to a height of about 8000 feet above the sea. Even
the mountain peaks have little individual character, and from
the high land whence seen do not show their true elevation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Nevertheless this portion of the range is a paradise for
botanists; plants are found here that are discoverable in no
other part of the Pyrenees. The granitic elevated plateau is
strewn with lakes, already alluded to, which are the sources
of the Ariège, the Aude, the Segre, and the Têt. The peasants
believe that these are relics of Noah’s flood, patches of water
that loitered and were left behind when the Deluge was past
and the flood was engulfed. And they are further convinced
that the ark rested on the Puyg Péne. North and east of
the plateau the ground falls away in a series of terraces cleft
by ravines; the finest and best known of these latter is that
of the Aude, visited from the baths of Cascanières.</p>

<p>In this upland region is a fortress created by Vauban, Mont
Louis, in which a couple of companies are quartered, and
spend a joyless time, where the winter lasts ten months out
of the twelve. The fortifications enclose but a handful of
houses. It stands at the height of 5280 feet above the sea,
and is commanded by mountains that rise to 6685 feet, as the
Pic de la Tausse, but they do not impress one with sense of
height. Mont Louis stands at the point of suture of the
three little provinces out of which Louis XIII formed that of
Roussillon&mdash;the Conflent, the Capcir, and Cerdagne.</p>

<p>In Mont Louis there is nothing to be seen of particular interest.
The church was built from designs of Vauban. On
the terrace is the monument of General Dagobert, who died in
1794. It consists of a pile of granite surmounted by a bomb.
Dagobert was, however, not a native of this place, but of
Saint Lô, in Manche. He had been sub-lieutenant in the
regiment of Touraine in the Seven Years’ War, and when the
Revolution broke out he was sent as General of Division with
the army of Italy, and met with some success. He was less
fortunate when commanding an army in the Pyrénées Orientales;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
he met with defeat at Trouillas, and was relieved of
his charge and arrested. But he succeeded in justifying himself,
before the Committee of Public Safety, by showing that
his failure was due to the jealousy and disobedience of the
generals placed under his orders. He was re-established in
his position and allowed to carry on the campaign according
to a plan proposed by himself to the Convention. He reached
Perpignan in March, 1794, but could not obtain from Dugommier
more than a few battalions in place of the 12,000 infantry
and 600 cavalry that had been ordered to be placed at his
disposal. At the head of a small body of men he went to
Puygcerda and invaded Catalonia, took the strong position of
Monteska, and surrounded Urgel. On 10 April he entered
that city, which redeemed itself from sack by paying a contribution
of 10,000 francs. Then he attempted to besiege
the citadel, but found it to be too strong to be taken, and
he retreated on the morrow. He was conveyed ill to Puygcerda
on 17 April, where he died.</p>

<p>To the south-east of Mont Louis is Planès, where there is a
curious church, some suppose of Moorish constructure, by
others attributed to the tenth century, by others again set as
late as the twelfth. It consists of an equilateral triangle, surmounted
by a cupola, and each angle rounded off. That this
curious monument should be of Moorish origin is most improbable.
The Arabs in France destroyed much, but built
nothing.</p>

<p>The hermitage of Font-Romeu is a pilgrimage resort with a
Calvary, situated at the height of 5330 feet, and commanding
a wide panorama.</p>

<p>The way to it is through a pine wood, the old trees bearded
with grey lichen. A hermit takes charge of the shrine&mdash;a real
hermit, one of the rare survivals; they are now almost as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
extinct as the dodo and the great auk. The sanctuary is the
very Mecca of Cerdagne and Capcir. On 8 September as many
as three thousand pilgrims assemble here; the place is like a
disturbed ant-heap. The visitors do not restrain themselves
to devotional exercises; they also dine, drink, sing. Then
may be seen the white caps, laced, of Conflent and Roussillon;
the kerchief of glaring colours&mdash;red, yellow, and blue&mdash;of the
women of Cerdagne; men wearing the red <i>barretina</i> and the
cord-soled <i>spadrillos</i>, Catalonians these who have not abandoned
their old costume. The miraculous image is a seated
Madonna, with head and hands out of all proportion to the
body. It spends the winter in the church of Odeillo, but revisits
Font-Romeu as soon as the rhododendrons begin to
flush the mountain sides.</p>

<p>In winter Mont Louis is a cold and wretched prison. Clouds
envelop the mountain-tops, cold rain and heavy falls of snow
alternate with furious and icy gales. In summer the vapours
often fill the valley, and from the ramparts of Mont Louis is
seen the spectacle of a vast plain of snow, recalling the scenes
of winter; but the snow now is the surface of cloud lying low,
silvered by the light from above.</p>

<p>This wild country saw the end of Othman abu Nessu, the
Moorish Governor of Narbonne.</p>

<p>In 725 Ambessa, Moslem Governor of Spain, crossed the
Pyrenees. Cascassonne and Nîmes vainly endeavoured to resist
him. In the midst of his successes, however, death surprised
him. But he left the Arabs masters of Septimania,
where they established themselves in force and made Narbonne
their capital. The struggle between Moslem and Christian for
the possession of the soil of France now became a struggle
desperate in its earnestness.</p>

<p>Eudes, Duke of Aquitania, was at the time hampered by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
attack from the North by Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks.
In his extremity he made overtures to Othman, Governor of
Narbonne, who was not a Saracen, but a Moor. The Moors
were Berbers from Northern Africa, of the same blood as the
Iberians of Spain; they had been conquered by the Arabs
and forced to become Mahomedans. Eudes gave his beautiful
daughter Lampagia to Othman, who became deeply
attached to his Christian wife, and promised his assistance
against the new Emir, Abderahman. This latter came over
the Col de Perche and threatened Narbonne. Othman was
deserted by his men, and fled to Llivia with his wife and a
few attendants. He soon perceived that it was not possible
to defend the little town, and he escaped and attempted to
cross the Col de Morens. In his flight he was entreated to
halt by Lampagia, to slake her thirst at a spring and rest on
the turf by it. Othman and she were surrendering themselves
to the pleasing hope that they were safe, when they saw a detachment
of Saracens in full pursuit.</p>

<p>The servants took to flight, but Lampagia was too weary
to join them, and Othman would not abandon his wife. In a
moment they were surrounded, and Othman, rather than fall
into the hands of his enemies, flung himself down the precipice
and perished. His head was cut off and sent to Abderahman
along with Lampagia. She was so lovely in the eyes of
the Emir that he sent her to Damascus to the Commander
of the Faithful.</p>

<p>Abderahman pursued his successes, but met with discomfiture
on the fields of Poitiers in October, 732, and he himself
was among the slain.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Pyrenees, before expiring in the cliffs of Cerbère, that
drop abruptly into the Mediterranean, make a supreme
effort and rise in the Canigou, which, though not one of the
first-class heights, is certainly one of the finest. A certain
bashfulness prevails among the giants. The Vignemale, the
Mont Perdu, the Maladetta retreat behind screens of less
elevation and conceal their majesty. But the Canigou makes
the most of herself. The height is but 9135 feet, yet it is
a stately mountain, grey with eternal snows, as its name
implies, and yielding to none in dignity.</p>

<p>Comeliness in a woman is enhanced threefold when she is
well set up. Canigou is admirably set up. The fringe of
subsidiary hills that hitherto has intervened between the high
ranges and the plain here becomes detached and drifts away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
to the north-east, as the Corbières, leaving the Canigou to reap
the advantage of showing from head to foot. It is not even
the highest mountain of the Pyrénées Orientales; it is surpassed
by the Carlitte, which is 9780 feet, and the Puig Mal,
which is 9730 feet; but as these two summits are confounded
among a number of other heights rising out of the elevated
plateau, it seems impossible, at first sight, to suppose them
to be as lofty as the Canigou. This latter mountain is the
termination of a chain that breaks away from the main
range in a north-easterly direction, built up of granite and
mica schist, and is composed of the junction of two ridges,
which give to the Canigou the appearance of having two heads.
It dominates the whole plain of Roussillon, and has inspired
a song known to every peasant there, who, if he does not sing
all the words, warbles the air. This song may be rendered
into English <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <i>Goigs</i> are the “Joys,” sacred songs or carols in
honour of the Virgin and the Saints. The best known is that
in praise of Our Lady of Font-Romeu. The “Goigs dels
Ous” “Carol of the Eggs,” sung everywhere, an Easter song,
is trolled in the streets and throughout the night on the eve
of that great festival. One of the chanters carries a basket,
to receive eggs and any other contributions accorded to the
carolers.</p>

<p>On the Place at Vernet, on Sundays and on the local fête,
may be seen Catalan dances about the great elm tree. Unfortunately
these dances have lost much of their primitive
character since the <i>cornet-à-piston</i> has displaced the old bagpipe.
The ancient <i>bals</i>, <i>sardanas</i>, and <i>seguedillas</i> are danced
less frequently every year. The <i>bal</i> is a musical pastoral representing
the love-making of a youth and his lass; but this
is changing its features, and degenerating into a gallop. The
<i>sardana</i> and the <i>seguedilla</i> were ballads, the tunes of which
were taken by the <i>joglars</i>, or minstrels, for country dances,
but to which formerly the performers sang.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the degeneration of the dances, the tourist
will see in them some traits of the light-hearted character of
the people, will be interested in the traditional music, and be
pleased with the quaintness of the scene, like a bit out of an
opera.</p>

<div id="if_p274" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p274.jpg" width="600" height="405" alt="" /><div class="caption">VERNET LES BAINS</div></div>

<p>The peaks of Canigou may be reached by train either on the
north or on the south. The northern line from Perpignan
leads to Prades and Villefranche de Conflent for Vernet,
whence the visitor will be able to ascend the Canigou by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
funicular railway in course of construction. The other way is
by the Valespir to Amelie les Bains and Arles-sur-Tech.</p>

<p>We will begin with the first, and not halt till we reach
Prades, though there is much on the way of interest. The
plain of Prades is two and a half miles wide by two long, not
very extensive, but enjoying so sweet a climate, and having
such a fertile soil, and so well watered, that fruit and vegetables
grow there in marvellous abundance. Prades is a pleasant
little town, but without much of interest in its public
buildings. The church was completed in 1686 in the unattractive
style affected at that period. But if Prades itself lacks
antiquities, it is not so with the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>If the visitor likes to run back to the third station on the
line by which he has arrived, i.e. to Boule-Ternère, and ascend
the lateral valley for five miles, or else take a carriage from
Vinca, he can see one of the most interesting monuments of
medieval architecture in Roussillon. This is an Augustinian
priory of Serrabonna, founded in 1082; Artal II, Bishop of
Elne, consecrated the church in 1151. The church consists
of a nave and two side aisles, which are cut off from the nave;
that on the south, standing on the edge of a precipice, was
formerly open to sun and air, supported on columns of white
marble, the capitals sculptured with all the richness and
quaintness affected in the early twelfth century. The sun
has mellowed the marble to a rich golden hue. This aisle is
now converted into a stable. The north aisle communicated
with the galilee or pro-naos, and with the choir. Between
the doorway into the cemetery and that into the nave is the
galilee, opening outwards, through a large portal covered
with magnificent sculptures. The galilee is composed of a
hall supported by round-headed arches resting on pillars, single
and double, with richly sculptured capitals all in white marble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
The priory is situated in a wild and desolate region, thinly
populated.</p>

<p>Nearer to Prades, within an easy walk, is another ruined
religious house, S. Michel de Cuxa, founded in the ninth
century. The abbot wore the mitre and exercised quasi-episcopal
jurisdiction over fifteen parishes. The abbey
obtained a high repute on account of the sanctity of several
of its members, as S. Romuald and Peter Orseolo, the latter
of whom had been Doge of Venice.</p>

<p>The situation is delightful. The monastery is planted on
the summit of a hill above the waters of the Riberetta. About
it is an amphitheatre of mountains, opening out to the south
to afford a full view of the Canigou. Springs of pure cold
water gush forth in many places. The great abbey is now in
such complete ruin that it is difficult to distinguish the parts
of the monastic building. The splendid cloister has been
destroyed, and portions have been transferred to adorn the
baths at Prades. The church is Romanesque, with a pointed
choir. The nave is now roofless, and is used for a storehouse.
The church formerly possessed two towers: one fell in 1839,
the other leans. The story goes that the architect who built
it, finding that his erection was out of the perpendicular, ran
away, and was never heard of again. The fine Renaissance
doorway of the abbot’s house is intact. It is richly carved
in white marble, yellowed by the sun, and is surmounted by a
sundial, on which is represented a Benedictine monk looking
up at the sun, and bearing the inscription, <i>Sub uno solis radio
omnem mundum collectum conspexit</i>.</p>

<p>Five miles above Prades is Villefranche, the terminus of the
railway. It is a dreary little place built of grey marble that
discolours and stains black. Moreover, it consists of two
streets only, usually empty; and the houses are too many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
for the small population, numbering less than five hundred.
The town was built by William Raymond, Count of Cerdagne,
in 1095. He surrounded the town with a wall flanked by
towers. The castle was erected by Vauban, on a spur of the
limestone mountain of Belloch, 450 feet above the river Tet,
and reached by a subterranean staircase of 999 steps. In
this castle were confined for the rest of their lives two of the
assistants of the infamous Marquise de Brinvilliers. These
were La Chappelain and Guesdon. A very brief notice of
the Marchioness and her crimes must suffice. She was a
young and beautiful woman, connected both by birth and
marriage with some of the noblest families of France, and was
married to the Marquis de Brinvilliers, a man of depraved
conduct. She formed a guilty attachment for Sainte Croix,
a gay, handsome man, who had learned in Italy the manufacture
of slow poisons, especially the Succession Powder.
The Marquis and Marchioness separated, but were not divorced.
Sainte Croix, who had no fortune of his own, depended on
what was given him by his mistress, and as this did not suffice,
he proposed to her to poison her old father and brothers and
sister, so as to gather into her own hands all their succession.
She agreed without hesitation, and herself administered the
fatal draught to her father. The brothers were next got rid
of, and the sister would have been similarly destroyed had
not her suspicions been roused, and she hastily quitted Paris.
Others who were inconvenient in one way or another were
similarly got rid of, but all was done with such caution that
no charge could be made against either. But the day of
retribution was at hand, and a terrible mischance brought the
murders to light. The nature of the poisons was so deadly
that when Sainte Croix worked in his laboratory, he was
obliged to wear a mask, to preserve himself from suffocation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
One day the mask slipped off, and the miserable wretch
perished in his crimes. His corpse was found on the following
morning in the obscure lodging where he had fitted up his
laboratory, and with it papers which disclosed the whole
series of murders perpetrated by the pair. The Marchioness
fled to England, where she remained for three years, but went
early in 1676 to Liège. There she was caught, brought to
Paris, executed, and her body burnt.</p>

<p>La Guesdon, along with her husband, had been in the
service of Sainte Croix, and before her marriage had been in
that of the Marchioness. She had been implicated in the
poisonings. La Chappelain had acted in Paris the part of a
fortune-teller. By means of her supposed prevision of the
future she was able to presage the death of those marked
down by Mme. de Brinvilliers and Sainte Croix for destruction.
La Guesdon died in the prison at Villefranche in 1717, La
Chappelain in 1724.</p>

<p>In the place itself is the opening into an extensive cavern.
In 1674 a conspiracy was raised to capture the citadel and
deliver it over to the Spaniards. It was widely ramified
through the Cerdagne and Roussillon, neither content at
having been made over to France by the Treaty of the
Pyrenees. Some of the leading spirits in the plot were the
men of the family of Llar, in Villefranche, whose dilapidated
and dingy <i>hôtel</i> may be seen in the Rue des Juifs. The cavern
mentioned served as a place of meeting and a storehouse for
arms. The conspiracy was betrayed by Inez de Llar, daughter
of the chief man in the plot, Charles de Llar. He and her
brother and relatives involved in it were executed. The
unfortunate Inez, broken-hearted at having brought ruin on
her family, ended her days in a convent.</p>

<p>In 1793 the Spanish general Crespo succeeded in making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
himself master of Villefranche, on 4 August; but on 19 September,
Gilly, at the head of the second battalion of the
Grenadiers of Gard, composed of 450 men, retook the place
by an act of audacity. He disposed his men on the heights
as though the vanguard of an army, and then rode up to the
outposts with sixty grenadiers behind him, and haughtily
summoned the Spanish commandant to surrender to General
Dagobert, whose army, he said, was at hand, and who would
give no quarter if the place were not immediately given up.</p>

<p>The frightened Crespo consented, and an hour later Gilly
entered Villefranche at the head of the little army.</p>

<p>From Villefranche the distance is hardly five miles to Vernet,
up the valley of the Riu Major. The road passes Corneilla,
where there is a curious Romanesque church with a square
tower and a fine marble, sculptured doorway, as also, what is a
rare feature, a retable of carved marble of 1345, by an artist
named Carcall de Berga. It represents incidents in the life
of our Lord. At the Revolution it was pulled down, but was
re-erected by an unintelligent mason, who put it together
badly, as may be seen by the disorder into which the inscriptions
have been thrown. The counts of Cerdagne were much
attached to Corneilla, and erected here a palace, which was
abandoned later and given up to the Augustinian canons.</p>

<p>Vernet is built in an amphitheatre of verdure, commanded
by the buttresses of the Canigou. It is composed of two
distinct parts, of very different aspect. The upper town is a
tangle of little streets between mean, black houses with
broken windows and rickety doors, above whose red tiled
or slated roofs rise the church and the castle. New Vernet
lies along the road lower down, and there are found the baths,
the hotels, and the casino. The watering-places of Bagnères
de Luchon, Cauterez, S. Sauveur, etc., are frequented only in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the months of June, July, August, and rarely September;
but at Vernet the season begins in April, and bathers linger
on to November. For the use of winter residents a <i>jardin
d’hiver</i> has been formed. The cold here is never great; and
the salubrity of the spot has induced the erection of an open-air
cure sanatorium at the height of 2250 feet, in an isolated
position, for the use of consumptives.</p>

<p>From Vernet the ascent of the Canigou can be made on
foot or by the newly-constructed cog-railway. There is a
station at S. Martin de Canigou, an abbey founded at the
edge of a precipice in 1007 by Count Waifre of Cerdagne, and
his wife Gisella. Tradition will have it that he was engaged
in warfare with the Moors, and had planned to surround them.
He committed one detachment of troops to his son, with
strict injunctions to delay attack till he himself should appear.
But the young man, in his impetuosity, fell on the unbelievers
before the arrival of the Count, and was defeated. Waifre
in a rage killed him, and then repenting of what he had done,
went to Rome, where the Pope required him to build and
endow a monastery in expiation of his crime. This is, however,
mere fable. As a matter of fact, the foundation was
wholly voluntary, and Count Waifre, after having built it
retired from the world within its walls, and occupied his
leisure in scooping out a sarcophagus that was to contain
himself eventually, which sarcophagus, now empty, is still
shown. He died in 1049. The abbey, having been dismantled
at the Revolution, fell into complete ruin, but has been
purchased, and the church restored by Bishop du Pont of
Perpignan. He has also revived the pilgrimage to it, which
takes place on S. Martin’s Day (11 November), when a procession
winds up the mountain from Vernet. Whether procession
and pilgrims will henceforth go up in trucks by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
cog-railway remains to be seen. The church is a very interesting
example of earliest Romanesque, the aisles are
separated from the nave by granite columns very massive,
with Byzantine ornament on the capitals. Beneath the
church is the crypt.</p>

<p>The second way to reach the roots of the Canigou, and, if
it be desired, to ascend it, is to take the branch line from
Elne to Arles-sur-Tech. At Le Boulou (lo Volo) the line
crosses the Great Eastern highway into Spain, the main pass
from Narbonne to Barcelona in Roman and medieval times, and
used by Celts and Iberians before ever Narbonne and Barcelona
were thought of. Le Boulou did well as a place through
which travellers and merchandise streamed this way and that.
But then came the days of steam; the iron road was carried
along the coast from Perpignan to Barcelona, and Le Boulou’s
occupation and prosperity were gone never to return.</p>

<p>Beyond Le Boulou we reach Ceret, famous for its bridge,
a daring medieval structure, and for its nuts and cherry
orchards. The architect employed on the bridge, unable to
throw the bold arch over the Tech, put himself in communication
with the Devil, who promised to complete it for the
usual consideration. As the fatal day approached the architect
became uneasy, and in the night went to the river with
a sack on his back, and waited till half-past eleven. Then
he let loose a cat with a kettle tied to its tail, and the Evil One,
frightened at the noise, let drop the last stone needed to
complete the bridge and fled. Thus the bridge never was
finished; it lacks one stone to the present day. The bridge
spans the river with a single arch, and the height from the
key of the arch to the level of the water is 70 feet. The
opening of the arch between the piers is 128 feet. It remains
the boldest achievement in bridge-building accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
in ancient France, the only other approaching it was that of
Brioude, which no longer exists. This bridge was constructed
in 1321. It marked the limit of the Valespir, or
upper basin of the Tech.</p>

<p>Ceret really flourishes on hazel-nuts. The plantations
extend over other communes, but Ceret is the centre of the
industry. Three kinds of nuts are grown; the best is thought
to be indigenous; it has a russet shell, pointed, and is contained
in a cup divided into four lobes delicately striated.
The taste is superior to that of the other kinds, and it is in
greater request for the making of nougat. Inferior in taste,
but larger, is the second variety, usually sold to be served up
at dessert. The third kind is exotic, and is little cultivated.</p>

<p>The gathering of the nuts is done by women in the middle
of August. After that the nuts have been freed from their
cases, they are dried, and the sale begins in October. For
the production of nougat the shells are cracked and the
kernel released, and this latter is alone sent to the factories
of that dainty. A hazel-nut tree will bear the third year after
it has been planted, but is not calculated to render a good
crop till the fifth. A hectare (2 acres, 1 r., 35 p.) is reckoned
to render a crop that will bring in 130 francs.</p>

<p>A little over two miles above the bridge of Ceret is the
Hermitage of S. Ferreolus, on the left bank of the Tech.
Ferreolus was, so the story goes, a robber chieftain who committed
many murders. Seized with compunction, he resolved
on expiating his crimes by being rolled downhill from
where now stands the chapel, in a barrel, studded internally
with nails, a process the same as that which extinguished
Regulus. His festival is on 18 September, on which day the
chapel is visited, and there is much eating and drinking and
dancing. On the following Sunday is bull-baiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
The line passes within sight of Pallada, most picturesquely
situated, at some distance from the iron road; but Pallada
is best visited from Amalie des Bains.</p>

<p>The baths were known to and used by the Romans, but
were a dependency of Arles-sur-Tech, and so remained till
that needy little town in a weak moment disposed of them in
1813, and has regretted the sale ever since.</p>

<p>Amelie, which takes its name from Queen Amelie, occupies
a specially favoured site. Mountains fold about it, it faces
the sun, and is screened from every wind. The terrible
Tramontane, which has bowed the olives and plane trees in
Roussillon and Languedoc, is powerless to reach this blessed
valley. The north-east wind indeed can steal up the ravine
of the Tech, but not till it has been despoiled of its humidity,
which renders it so objectionable to the inhabitants of the
plain. Frost and snow rarely visit Amelie; the mean number
of days when rain falls in the winter is eleven, in spring
thirty-two, sixteen in the summer, and twelve in the autumn.
There is a military establishment of baths at Amelie, and the
place is much frequented by officers during the winter, so that
it is never utterly deserted and dead, as is the generality of
watering-places.</p>

<p>Amelie has been formed as a commune out of scraps taken
from others, but mainly from Arles-sur-Tech, to which the
springs originally belonged. Arles is a very curious town,
vastly ancient, and is the terminus of the line. Its principal
manufacture is chocolate. The little town stands on a height,
and is surrounded by mountains. Arles owes its medieval
revival to a Benedictine abbey of which a considerable
portion remains to this day. The abbot exercised almost
episcopal jurisdiction over several parishes, of which he was
also temporal lord. In the sixteenth century it was in full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
decay, and was so poor that its finances had to be helped out
by annexing to it the funds of another abbey. The reason
was that it was held <i>in commendam</i>, the revenue eaten by a
titular abbot who resided in Paris, and discharged none
of his duties.</p>

<p>The church of the monastery was finished in 1040, and is
very archaic. It underwent, however, additions in 1157,
when the curious vaulting was added. As a doubt was
entertained whether the piers would sustain it, they were
strengthened, and smaller arches added beneath those first
erected. The church reminds one of the monolithic church of
S. Emillon on the Garonne. The same square, massive piers
rising to a great height, quite unadorned, support the round-headed
unmoulded arches. Above each arch is a small,
round-headed clerestory window. The church consists of
five bays, and the nave has side aisles, out of which open
chapels of much later construction. There was in the church
at one time a richly carved altar-piece of the fifteenth century.
But when the present detestable roccoco retable was erected,
this was destroyed. Some of the panels were happily preserved
and affixed to the pillars in the nave.</p>

<p>Outside the church the western portal is early, with a triangular
lintel, on which is cut a shield with A.ω between
A and A. The meaning of these double A’s is not understood.
In the diminutive yard without, behind is a grating, of an early
sarcophagus that contained the bodies of saints Abdo and
Senen. It possesses the curious property of filling with water,
which can be drawn off by a tap at the side to supply bottles
brought by pilgrims, who consider the water as efficacious in
many maladies. How it is that the sarcophagus thus fills
with water is not known; probably the clergy of the church
do not themselves know, as the heavy lid has not been removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
for centuries, nor the stone coffin shifted from the spot
where it now stands.</p>

<p>But the greatest beauty of the church consists in the large
cloister on the north side, of the thirteenth century. The
arches are pointed, and rest on graceful pillars with dainty
foliaged capitals, all of marble, and coupled. The cloister
is not vaulted. This cloister was begun in 1261, but was not
completed till the beginning of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The patrons of the church are SS. Abdo and Senen,
Persian saints who suffered under Decius in 252. In the
reign of Constantine the Great their relics were enshrined in
Rome, and the marble sarcophagus that contained them still
exists there, and their remains are in the church of S. Mark,
Rome; but also here. Their day, 30 July, is a high festival at
Arles, when the sleepy town is full of animation, and dances
take place in the public square; then can be seen the red
<i>barretina</i> and the gaily-coloured kerchiefs of the women.</p>

<p>Farther up the valley is a watering-place, Prats de Mollo.
The name Prats, as Prades, which occurs in so many parts of
the south, derives from the Latin <i>prates</i>, and signifies pleasant
meadows by the water-side. The industry of Prats is the
making of the red caps worn by the Catalans, and the rope-woven
soles of <i>spadrillos</i>. The place enjoyed great privileges
under the kings of Aragon, among these was freedom from
duty on salt. Louis XIV sought to introduce it, but the
people rose and slaughtered the tax-collectors. Louis sent
troops to subdue them, and erected a fortress to intimidate
them. On a mountain above Prats le Coral is a pilgrimage
chapel containing a miraculous image of the Virgin. Crowds
visit it&mdash;pilgrims from the country round, and bathers from
Amelie&mdash;to see the combined devotion and jollification on
8 September.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> old county of Roussillon, between Languedoc and
Catalonia, formerly pertained to Spain; it was pledged
to Louis XI of France by King John of Aragon along with
the Cerdagne. The stipulation was that these counties should
remain to France should John fail to redeem them in nine
years with the sum of three hundred gold crowns, which the
crafty Louis knew was a sum John could not raise. John,
finding his inability to pay, stirred up the people of Roussillon
to revolt against French domination, whereupon Louis poured
thirty thousand men into the country, and during fifteen years
it underwent all the miseries of war. Perpignan capitulated
in 1475, and Roussillon remained in the hands of the French
till 1493, when the feeble Charles VIII restored it, along with
the Cerdagne, to the King of Aragon. At this time Aragon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
and Castille, united by the marriage of Ferdinand the Catholic
with Isabella, formed from 1479 the kingdom of Spain.</p>

<p>In 1493 Ferdinand made his solemn entry into Perpignan,
and brought the Inquisition in his train. The already severely
tried county was further tortured by the Inquisitors, and the
inhabitants were driven to desperation. They appealed to
Francis I for relief, and he was induced to attempt the recovery
of Roussillon, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<div id="if_p286" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/p286.jpg" width="600" height="401" alt="" /><div class="caption">CHATEAU DE ROUSSILLON</div></div>

<p>Under the fanatical Philip II the county was a prey to
plague as well as persecution, so that hatred against Spain
became intense. Philip III, sensible of this, endeavoured to
cajole the citizens of Perpignan by transferring to it the seat
of the bishopric from Elne, and by ennobling several of the
leading citizens, but succeeded in doing no more than in
forming a small Spanish faction in the town.</p>

<p>In 1610 all Catalonia was in revolt against Philip IV, and
the county of Roussillon followed the example of Barcelona.
The King of Spain sent troops to Perpignan and massacred
the citizens. Those who survived the carnage appealed to
Louis XIII, who sent an army into the county, and in 1642
the French, entering Perpignan, were hailed as deliverers. In
1659 the Treaty of the Pyrenees finally assured to France the
possession of Roussillon and half of Cerdagne, and since then
these have formed an integral portion of France.</p>

<p>But before all this for a while Perpignan was the capital of
the short-lived kingdom of Majorca. James I, King of
Aragon, in 1229 had expelled the Moors from that island, and
in 1238 from Valencia; and to the title King of Aragon he
added those of King of Majorca and Valencia, Count of
Barcelona and of Roussillon and Urgel, and Seigneur of Montpellier.
To his eldest son Peter he left Aragon, and to the
younger, James, he gave the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
James I of Majorca was succeeded by his son Sanchez,
who died without issue in 1324, and the next and last king
was James II, son of Ferdinand, the brother of Sanchez.
James married his cousin Constance, sister of Peter IV of
Aragon.</p>

<p>Peter was an ambitious man and insatiate in his greed. He
resolved on the destruction of his cousin and brother-in-law,
and the annexation of his dominions. James had made himself
unpopular by his tyranny, and the islanders complained
to the Aragonese king. This was precisely what Peter wanted;
he summoned James to meet him in conference at Barcelona,
arrested his sister Constance, and would have done the same
by his brother-in-law had not James found means to escape.
In the impotence of his resentment he declared war against
Aragon, and thereby sealed his own fate. In 1343 Peter
landed in Majorca, and was at once joined by the islanders.
Then he turned his attention to Roussillon and overran it.</p>

<p>The unfortunate James now solicited a safe conduct, and
throwing himself at the feet of the victor, implored forgiveness
in consideration of kinship. He might as well have
appealed to a rock. He was informed that if he would surrender
Perpignan, that still held out for him, he would experience
his brother-in-law’s clemency. He consented; but
no sooner was Peter in possession that he declared Roussillon
annexed in perpetuity to Aragon. The estates met, and
offered James a miserable indemnity of 10,000 French crowns.
He indignantly refused the offer. The Pope so far interfered
as to obtain the release from prison of his wife Constance,
and of James his eldest son. Unable to bear adversity with
patience, in 1349 he sold to the French king his lordship of
Montpellier, and with the money received raised 3000 foot
soldiers and 300 horsemen, in the wild hope of reconquering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
his kingdom. With this small force he embarked, and made
a descent on Majorca, but was deserted by the mercenaries
when his funds gave out, and in a battle against great odds
was killed, and his son James was wounded and taken prisoner.
This prince had been married to Joanna I, Queen of Naples,
who had murdered her first husband. Fearing to meet with
the same fate, and disgusted with her levity, he had left Naples
and had thrown in his lot with his father. For twelve years
he languished in prison, effected his escape in 1362, and died
of chagrin in 1375.</p>

<p>Roussillon takes its name from Ruscino, the ancient capital,
which was destroyed by the Northmen in 859. The site is
now occupied by a tower and a Romanesque chapel, a couple
of miles from Perpignan. The name of Ruscino appears for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the first time <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 218, when Hannibal crossed the Pyrenees
on his march into Italy. The Roman Senate sent ambassadors
to the people of Ruscino to urge them to oppose the progress
of the great Carthaginian. They met where is now this castle,
but were listened to with impatient murmurs. The tower,
that dates from the twelfth century, is all that remains of the
castle of the counts of Roussillon. No one has as yet undertaken
serious exploration of the site, which infallibly would
surrender very important relics of the ancient capital of the
Rusceni, one of the Nine Peoples, and where in all probability
the Phœnicians had a mercantile station; the plough,
or mattock, has repeatedly turned up Iberian, Greek, Punic,
Roman, and Arabic coins.</p>

<p>One cannot quit Castell-Rossello, as the tower is now called,
without mention of William de Cabestang, who was châtelain
of the neighbouring village of Cabestang. Taken with the
charms of Sirmonde, the wife of Raimond, Count of Roussillon,
he celebrated her in song. The husband, transported
with jealousy, had him waylaid and murdered, then tore out
his heart, had it roasted, and served at table. After Sirmonde
had partaken of the dish he revealed to her what she had eaten.
Then said she, “This meat has been to me so good and
savoury that no other shall pass my lips.” The Count at this
drew his sword, and Sirmonde threw herself from the window
and perished by the fall. Alphonso II of Aragon went to the
place, ordered the arrest of the Count, and the burial of the
troubadour and the Countess before the western entrance of
the church of S. Jean at Perpignan.</p>

<p>Perpignan, with its vast and huge citadel, cramped within
fortifications planned by Vauban, was formerly a fortress of
the first order. To-day, under changed systems of defence
and attack, citadel and bastions have lost their value, and the
walls and earthworks that gird the town about are now being
levelled, and the moat filled to form a boulevard. When that
red belt of bricks is completely demolished, Perpignan will
expand in all directions.</p>

<p>The little river Basse divides the town into two unequal
parts: the New Town, which is the ancient faubourg of the
Tanneries, was included within the circuit of the fortifications
by Vauban; and the Old Town, on the right bank of the
river, comprises the hills of S. Jacques and de la Réal; and
in this the streets are narrow and tortuous. In 1859 the
medieval wall of defence along the river front was demolished
and the Place Arago was made; a Palais de Justice and a
Prefecture were erected on its site. The citadel is on high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
ground above the town, and contains the palace of the kings
of Majorca. It is well to ascend the belvedere that surmounts
the palace chapel to obtain a good view of the plain
of Roussillon to the bald limestone range of the Corbières, to
the soaring mass of Canigou, and the Pyrenean range&mdash;here
called les Albères&mdash;and to the Mediterranean, blue as a peacock’s
neck, and the lagoons that lie along the coast. For
what Perpignan sorely lacks is a high terrace that would give
a view of the surrounding country and of the mountains.</p>

<p>Alphonso II, King of Aragon, to whom the last Count of
Roussillon bequeathed his county in 1172, did much for the
place. As a considerable part of the town lay low in marshy
and unhealthy ground, he desired to move it up the height,
at the foot of which was a leper hospital, and which for this
reason is called the Puig des Lépreux. But he met with
opposition from the inhabitants, and abandoned his intention.
Nevertheless the Puig became peopled by artisans, and this
portion was soldered on to the Old Town, and included later
within the ramparts.</p>

<p>The Place de la Loge is the centre of animation to the town,
the forum of the capital of Roussillon. It derives its name
from the Loge de la Mer, a court for naval and mercantile
affairs. This dates from 1397, but was reconstructed in 1540;
it is richly carved, but is somewhat weak in design, and
however elaborate is the ornamentation is not effective.
From the upper story is suspended a diminutive ship with
all its appointments. The lower story is given up to be a
café. Before this all the rollicking and fun of the carnival
takes place, not, as elsewhere, on Shrove Tuesday, but on Ash
Wednesday. Before this pass the fantastic cars bearing
maskers representing various trades or else allegorical groups.
Here goes on the battle of the <i>dragées</i>, when every one not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
masked, down to the baby in arms, wears a wire vizor over
his face, such as is employed by fencers, as a protection against
the <i>dragées</i>, which are as large as beans and as hard as pebbles.</p>

<p>It is somewhat startling to note the contrast presented on
Ash Wednesday between the scene in the cathedral, when the
whole congregation goes to the altar rails to have a cross of
ashes marked on each brow, with the words: “Remember,
O man, that dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return!”
and that in the Place de la Loge in the afternoon, when fun
runs fast and furious, and every one is playing the fool.</p>

<p>The cathedral was begun in 1324, and terminated in the
beginning of the sixteenth century. Externally it promises
little, but the interior is overwhelmingly beautiful. The
church is built of tiles rather than bricks, each 17 inches long
by 1½ inches thick and 8 inches wide; with bands of these
tiles alternate belts of cobble-stones arranged in herring-bone
fashion.</p>

<p>The interior consists of one vast nave 56 feet wide, in seven
bays and with transepts. The whole ends in a magnificent
apse. Between the buttresses are chapels, 17 feet deep, in
each of which is a three-light window most of these blocked
by retables, and this renders the church unnecessarily dark.
The high altar-piece of white marble, of the seventeenth century,
is an admirable composition, purely Renaissance in
character, executed by Bartholomew Soler, of Barcelona. In
the niches are statues of the Virgin, S. John, and SS. Julia
and Eulalia, patronesses of Elne. Particularly noticeable is
a superb carved oak and gilded reredos in the north transept,
of the fifteenth century, representing scenes of the Passion in
eight compartments. Another, enclosing fine paintings in
place of sculpture, is in the south transept. The huge organ-case
is a splendid bit of work of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
In the south of Languedoc a taste prevailed for churches
comprising huge naves without side aisles&mdash;in fact, immense
halls. At Carcassonne such is the type; but there, in the
two churches in the New Town, the effect is unsatisfactory,
as the chancels, or apses, bud out of the flat east wall in an
ungainly manner. Here in Perpignan we have the hall
interior, but leading up to and ending in an apse of the full
width of the nave.</p>

<p>On the south side of the church is a chapel with a highly
favoured crucifix in it, and Pope Leo XIII accorded plenary
indulgence with remission of all sins to such as should worship
before it and pray for the extermination of heresies, i.e.
heretics on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross.</p>

<p>The other churches of S. Mathieu and La Réal deserve a
visit. Built on the same lines as the cathedral, they have
been sadly spoiled by tasteless additions in the Barroque
period. Over the high altar at La Réal, as in a side chapel at
S. Mathieu, are groups of coloured statuary, on which light is
also made to fall from above; and as the churches are profoundly
dark, this is in its way effective.</p>

<div id="if_p294" class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;"><img src="images/p294.jpg" width="477" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">CATHEDRAL INTERIOR, PERPIGNAN</div></div>

<p>The ancient Palais de Justice, much purer in style than the
Loge, adjoins it, separated from it only by the old house of
the consuls, now the Hôtel de Ville. The old Palais has beautiful
windows, with trefoil heads cut in the block, unmoulded,
supported by dainty columns. But the most strikingly picturesque
edifice of Perpignan is the Castelet, erected between
1367 and 1369, with the town gate of Notre Dame (1481) at
one side of it, all constructed of tiles like the cathedral. The
bold projecting machicolations, and the octagonal turret surmounted
by a small cupola, have a pronounced Spanish
character.</p>

<p>When one passes out of the Porte Notre Dame the Promenade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
des Platanes is reached, a boulevard shaded by magnificent
plane trees, but all inclined from the north, from the
terrible Tramontane wind, which is the scourge of the plain
of Roussillon. Here on Shrove Tuesday evening hundreds of
maskers dance under the leafless branches, and sometimes in
spite of the cutting wind and dropping rain. The promenade
is then railed in, and soldiers are stationed to act as sentinels
to prevent the crowd entering and interfering with the dancers.
But the waltz music is too exhilarating to allow these sentinels
to soberly pace their distances, and I have seen them holding
their rifles and pirouetting up and down their beats with them
as if their firearms were lovely partners.</p>

<p>Beyond the Basse, where it flows into the Tet, is the faubourg
Notre Dame, very animated and peopled in part with
gipsies, or <i>gitanos</i>. They speak a language of their own, a
mixture of Arabic, Castillian, and Catalan. They are first
mentioned in Roussillon in an ordinance of 1512, that required
them to be cudgelled out of the country. It does not seem
that this order produced the effect desired, for they have been
found, and still are found, throughout the department, mainly
engaged in selling mules.</p>

<p>The first station out of Perpignan on the line to Barcelona
is Elne, long the seat of a bishop. It was the ancient Illiberis.
The name tells its origin. It derives from the Iberian, and
signifies the New City; and shows that it was a town founded
by these people before they were expelled or subjugated by
the Celts, who invaded the country in the fourth century before
Christ. When Hannibal crossed the Pyrenees he planted
his headquarters here, and hither came the heads of the Gaulish
tribe to make terms with him against Rome. At the same
time they made complaint of the conduct of some of his Carthaginian
soldiery. Hannibal listened to their grievances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
and decided that in any further cases of misconduct by his
soldiers these should be tried by a court composed of the wives
of the Gauls.</p>

<p>The Romans, when they occupied the land, neglected Illiberis,
and planted a colony at Ruscino. The town dwindled
to insignificance till Constantine refounded it and called it
after the name of his mother, Helena; and this is the name
it now bears, transformed into Elne. It was the scene of the
assassination of Constans, the son of the great Constantine.
He was an indolent, weak, and debauched prince, monarch of
the West. Whilst hunting in Gaul he received tidings of the
revolt of Magnentius, that the soldiers had mutinied, and that
emissaries had been dispatched to kill him. He fled to Illiberis,
but was overtaken here and put to death in 350, in the
thirtieth year of his reign.</p>

<p>Devastated by the Arabs, we do not hear of a bishop of
Elne till 783. After that the lordship of Elne was shared
between the bishop and the chapter. The seat of the bishop
was removed to Perpignan in 1602.</p>

<p>Elne occupies a sandstone rock, about which this town is
built, and is divided into the upper and the lower town. It
is a dull and sleepy place, that wakens into life only on the
festival of SS. Eulalia and Julia, when there is much merry-making
with processions, music, and dancing. Portions of
the walls and some of the gates remain; but the great object
of interest is the cathedral, with its superb cloisters of white
marble. The exact date of the rebuilding is not known, but
the church was complete in 1069. Externally it is constructed
of rubble stone in herring-bone, set in mortar. The
west front has a crenellated gable between two towers of unequal
size and height. The loftiest is a bold structure that
has had buttresses added to it much later, in 1415. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
western doorway is unornamented. The plan of the church
is a nave with side aisles and no transepts. It is very plain
within as without, with huge piers supporting round-headed
arches and vault. The high altar was of silver, and dated
from 1069, but was sent to the mint at Perpignan to be coined
into money in 1721. The new altar-piece is as Prosper
Mérimée described it&mdash;“a masterpiece of meanness and bad
taste.”</p>

<p>The original choir stalls were fine. A writer in 1787 says
of the woodwork: “It is grand, and remarkable for the
beauty of the stall-work covered with sculpture of the end
of the thirteenth century, as is known by an inscription on
one of the stalls.” All this has disappeared.</p>

<p>In the sacristy is preserved a little bell with the date on it,
1554, ornamented with a figure of Apollo playing on the
<i>rebec</i>, a monkey doing the same, and dancing bears, an eagle,
a rabbit, and a boar.</p>

<p>But the great glory of Elne is its cloister raised on a terrace
of the ancient acropolis of Illiberis, on the north side of the
cathedral. Entrance to it is obtained by a doorway, which
for the purity of its style and the sobriety of its ornamentation
deserves notice. The arch is pointed, and of marble,
alternatively white and red, and dates from the fourteenth
century. The ironwork of the door is simple but graceful.
Alart, the historian and antiquary says: “Without dispute,
from the point of view of art, and from the historic reminiscences
attached to it, the cloister is the most remarkable
and precious relic that remains of Roussellonnaise architecture.”
It was begun in the twelfth century, but was continued and
retouched in the fourteenth, so that whereas some of the
capitals and columns are of Byzantine or Romanesque design,
others have Gothic ornament. All is in white marble, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the sculpture is of exquisite delicacy: foliage, figures of every
description are there in lavish profusion. The pillars are
coupled, some twisted, some plain. The very bases are enriched
with ornament.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the morning, in summer, when the sun lights up the
galleries to north and west, all the details come out with
extraordinary brilliancy. In the afternoon the eastern gallery
is burnt by the solar rays that have turned the marble
yellow.”&mdash;P. Vidal.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the lateral wall on the north side open two doorways,
one of which must be entered with precaution, or one may
fall below, for the stair that led from it has disappeared.
Underneath are two large vaulted chambers paved with
bricks, communicating one with another by a small opening.
Traces of fresco painting may be noticed. The popular
opinion is that these were the dungeons of the Inquisition,
but actually they were an old chapel dedicated to S. Laurence.
The other door gives access to a spiral staircase leading to a
terrace, from which a magnificent view is obtained of the
plain, the Albères, and Canigou.</p>

<p>Arles-sur-Mer is a watering-place by the sea. Near it is
the more interesting port of Collioure, an Iberian name
signifying the port of the New Town; and Iberian coins
have been found there. The fortress of S. Elne was built by
Charles V. The streets are narrow, the houses dilapidated,
and occupied mainly by fishermen and their families.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On the sea-coast these men enter into very hot discussions,
use expressions somewhat rough and coarse, but rarely come to
blows. Few scandals occur here, and they marry young. It is
worthy of remark that among these good folk so free of tongue
and freer still in opinion, these solid republicans, the religious
sentiment is very developed. They pray to God and go to Mass;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
but they also go to the ball. The three last days of carnival are
given up by the whole population to a wild frenzy. They cling
to this poor carnival as though it would never return. Every
café has its ball at night; if weather permit there is a general ball
in the public square.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A few yards from the beach on a rock stands a chapel
dedicated to S. Vincent, who is traditionally held to have
been born at Collioure. He was martyred at Valencia in
Spain, 304. But Huesca also claims the honour of his birth.
His name is included in the English Church calendar on 22
January. From the rock of S. Vincent on 16 August, annually,
at nine o’clock in the evening, starts a procession of boats
that brings the relics of the saint to the town. The sailing-boats
and fishing-vessels richly decked and illuminated with
coloured lamps are reflected in the still sea. An immense
crowd is gathered about the harbour, that is lighted by a
bonfire made of vine twigs and barrels of tar.</p>

<p>As soon as the vessel bearing the relics arrives at the quay,
the harbour-master calls out, “What boat is that?” To
which the captain replies, “A boat of Saint Vincent.”
“Whence come you?” “From Saint Vincent-de-l’Ile.”
“With what are you laden?” “With the relics of the Saint
Vincent, of Saint Marinus, and of Saint Liberada.” “Are
there passengers, and are they according to rule?” “There
are passengers, and they are all according to rule.” “What
do you require?” “To be allowed to disembark.” “In
the name of God, do so.”</p>

<p>Then the whole crowd shouts, “Sant Vincens béneit!”
Whereupon the boat is hauled ashore and dragged through
the town. The crowd that separated to allow of the passage
then unites and follows in a dense mass, elbowing one another.
The boat halts before the “Vierge des quatres coins,” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
relics are removed from it, and carried processionally to the
church. The bonfire and the coloured lamps go out, and
the scene of movement is transferred from the harbour to the
Place, where the <i>joglars</i>, installed on an improvized platform,
sound their instruments to lively melodies, and all, young
and old, in two minutes are in full swing of a dance, that
lasts from ten o’clock to midnight. “Si réellement,” says a
French writer, “la danse est un amusement, nulle part au
monde ou ne s’amuse autant qu’ ici.”</p>

<p>The train, as it traverses the flats and athwart arms of the
lagoons that lie along the coast, skirts a place called Salses,
and if the traveller be looking out of the window on the right
hand, he catches a glimpse of a rusty mass of building with
towers, and wonders what it is. This is the fortress of Salses,
erected in 1497 by a Spanish engineer named Ramirez, and
it is sufficiently curious to merit a study, for it was built at
a time when the use of cannon was materially altering the
conditions of warfare, especially of sieges. The château,
though often menaced with destruction, indeed repeatedly
ordered to be levelled, has remained almost intact to the
present day. It forms a rectangle with a tower at each angle.
These towers give evidence of the hesitation of the engineer.
He was hampered by tradition, and had to introduce them
without knowing exactly that they had a purpose any longer.
But, on the other hand, he adopted an innovation, destined
to revolutionize the defence of fortresses, by creating bastions
isolated and in advance of the walls, like the demi-lunes of
modern citadels. As far as we know, this was the first instance
of their being employed. The castle was of some strategic
importance, as commanding the passage between the vast
Lagoon of Leucate and the barren ridge of the Corbières.</p>

<p>The last governor of the fortress was a nephew of Voltaire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
named La Houlière, who grew vines and made wine on his
wife’s estate; he sent a cask of the latter to his illustrious
uncle, and entreated him to obtain a market for his wines in
Russia. To which Voltaire replied, “I am sorry not to be
able to be of use to you in this matter, but the Empress at
this moment is too much occupied with the Turks who drink
no wine, and with the Germans who drink too much, to be
able to turn her attention to your generous liquor.”</p>

<p>When La Houlière, who commanded at Perpignan in April,
1793, learned the defeat of the French troops by the Spaniards,
he was so depressed that he blew out his brains.</p>

<p>Throughout the plain of Roussillon vines grow, and the wine
they produce is excellent. The canals of irrigation bordered
by trees traverse the plain; and, thanks to this semi-aquatic
condition, the vineyards do not present the monotony of
those of Narbonne and Beziers.</p>

<p>The dread of the cold winds over the snows of the Alps
and the Cevennes is everywhere apparent. Reeds grow in
the dykes to a great height, from twelve to fourteen feet, and
even more, and these are cut and formed into mats to barricade
the fields and gardens, and give some shelter to them
from the piercing blast that has bent every tree from the
direction whence it blows. Round Perpignan every patch
of flower or vegetable garden is thus hedged about.</p>

<p>At Perpignan the Count de Grammont met the Abbé
Poussatin, when he was retreating with the Prince of Condé
after the unsuccessful campaign in Catalonia, in 1647.
Grammont <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At last we arrived at Perpignan on a holiday; a company
of Catalans, who were dancing in the street, out of respect to the
prince, came forward to dance under his windows. Monsieur
Poussatin, in a little black jacket, danced in the middle of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
company, as if he were really mad. I immediately recognized
him as my countryman, from his manner of skipping and frisking
about. The prince was charmed with his humour and activity.
After the dance I sent for him, and inquired who he was. ‘A
poor priest, at your service, my lord,’ said he; ‘my name is
Poussatin, and Béarn is my native country. I was going into
Catalonia to serve in the infantry, for, God be praised, I can march
very well on foot; but since the war is happily concluded, if
your lordship pleases to take me into your service, I would follow
you everywhere, and serve you faithfully.’ ‘Monsieur Poussatin,’
said I, ‘my lordship has no great occasion for a chaplain; but
since you are so well disposed towards me, I will take you into
my service.’</p>

<p>“The Prince of Condé, who was present at this conversation,
was overjoyed at my having a chaplain. Poor Poussatin was in
a very tattered condition, and I had no time to provide him with a
proper habit at Perpignan; but giving him a spare livery of one of
the Marshal de Grammont’s servants, I made him get up behind
the prince’s coach, who was like to die with laughing every time he
looked at poor Poussatin’s uncanonical mien in a yellow livery.</p>

<p>“As soon as we arrived in Paris the story was told to the queen,
who at first expressed some surprise at it; this, however, did not
prevent her from wishing to see my chaplain dance; for in Spain
it is not altogether so strange to see ecclesiastics dance, as to see
them in livery.</p>

<p>“Poussatin performed wonders before the queen; but as he
danced with great sprightliness, she could not bear the savour
which his violent motions diffused through the room; the ladies
likewise began to pray for relief.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Eastern Pyrenees have, to my mind, been unduly
neglected, and yet they present scenes of great beauty, and
are very easily reached. To botanists they should be especially
attractive. The Val d’Eyne, near Mont Louis, is known to
possess flowers found nowhere else in the range. The ravine
of the Aude is as fine as any in the Hautes Pyrénées. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
are peaks that run up to 10,000 feet, and are covered with
snow all the year, and if the glaciers be insignificant, glaciers are
not essential to beauty. There are more mountain tarns here
than elsewhere, and some of these the largest in the Pyrenees.
In ecclesiastical architecture this is by far the richest portion
of the chain, as the churches have not been wrecked by the
Huguenots as in Béarn and Bigorre. And what is more,
there is less rain, there are clearer and bluer skies. Some
of the watering-places are sweet and sheltered nooks where
one can be in summer sunlight early in April, even at the end
of March, sheltered from every wind, and with excursions
possible all about them, and what is more, are not so
fashionable, not so savouring of Paris as Bagnères and
Luchon, Cauterez, and Eauxbonnes. In the heats of summer
no more cool and invigorating climate can be found than in
some of those towns and villages on lofty plateaux, like Mont
Louis. As to the Pyrenees in general, many best able to
judge and with widest experience of mountain scenery, prefer
them to the Alps of Switzerland and of Tyrol, so overrun
with the tripper and the herds conducted by Cook. The
colouring is richer and more varied, the foliage, the flowers
more abundant; and the peasantry have not lost their
simplicity, as have the Swiss.</p>

<p>I will conclude with the words of a Pyrenean poet, written
in his Gascon dialect, but rendered into French: “Puisse-je
remonter sur ces trônes flamboyants de porphyre et de glace,
ou tout est froid, même l’éclair; j’irai révoir du haut de ces
nues, ces horizons grands comme l’éternité, mais que je ne
trouverais jamais assez illimités. Et quand aura sonné
l’heure fatale et cruelle du repos, j’irais m’assoir au bord de
l’Océan ou de la Méditerranée, mais toujours en vue des
Pyrénées.”</p>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
